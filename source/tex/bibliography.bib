	abstract = {Thermodynamic aspects of chemical reactions have a long history in the physical chemistry literature. In particular, biochemical cycles require a source of energy to function. However, although fundamental, the role of chemical potential and Gibb's free energy in the analysis of biochemical systems is often overlooked leading to models which are physically impossible. The bond graph approach was developed for modelling engineering systems, where energy generation, storage and transmission are fundamental. The method focuses on how power flows between components and how energy is stored, transmitted or dissipated within components. Based on the early ideas of network thermodynamics, we have applied this approach to biochemical systems to generate models which automatically obey the laws of thermodynamics. We illustrate the method with examples of biochemical cycles. We have found that thermodynamically compliant models of simple biochemical cycles can easily be developed using this approach. In particular, both stoichiometric information and simulation models can be developed directly from the bond graph. Furthermore, model reduction and approximation while retaining structural and thermodynamic properties is facilitated. Because the bond graph approach is also modular and scaleable, we believe that it provides a secure foundation for building thermodynamically compliant models of large biochemical networks.},

	abstract = {Michaelis and Menten introduced to biochemistry the idea of time-scale separation, in which part of a system is assumed to be operating sufficiently fast compared to the rest so that it may be taken to have reached a steady state. This allows, in principle, the fast components to be eliminated, resulting in a simplified description of the system's behaviour. Similar ideas have been widely used in different areas of biology, including enzyme kinetics, protein allostery, receptor pharmacology, gene regulation and post-translational modification. However, the methods used have been independent and ad hoc. In the present study, we review the use of time-scale separation as a means to simplify the description of molecular complexity and discuss recent work setting out a single framework that unifies these separate calculations. The framework offers new capabilities for mathematical analysis and helps to do justice to Michaelis and Menten's insights about individual enzymes in the context of multi-enzyme biological systems.},

The SERCA model consists of a number of sub-states with partial reactions that are sensitive to Ca2+ and pH, and to the metabolites MgATP, MgADP, and Pi. Optimization of model parameters to fit experimental data favors a fully cooperative Ca2+-binding mechanism and predicts a Ca2+/H+ counter-transport stoichiometry of 2. Moreover, the order of binding of the partial reactions, particularly the binding of MgATP, proves to be a strong determinant of the ability of the model to fit the data. A thermodynamic investigation of the model indicates that the binding of MgATP has a large inhibitory effect on the maximal reverse rate of the pump. The model is suitable for integrating into whole-cell models of cardiac electrophysiology and Ca2+ dynamics to simulate the effects on the cell of compromised metabolism arising in ischemia and hypoxia.},

A lumping scheme is presented which exploits the differences in timescales associated with fast and slow transitions between model states, while maintaining the thermodynamic properties of the model. The goal of this approach is to contribute to modelling of the effects of disturbances to metabolism, associated with ischaemic heart disease, on cardiac cell function.

The approach is illustrated for the sodium-potassium pump in the myocyte. The lumping scheme is applied to produce a 4-state representation from the detailed 15-state model of Läuger and Apell, Eur. Biophys. J. 13 (1986) 309, for which the principles of free energy transduction are used to link the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis (ΔGATP) to the transition rates between states of the model. An iterative minimisation algorithm is implemented to determine the transition rate parameters based on the model fit to experimental data. Finally, the relationship between ΔGATP and pump cycling direction is investigated and compared with recent experimental findings.},

We suggest that energy minimization subject to functional constraints may be one such unifying principle. We compared the energy needed to produce action potentials singly and in trains for a wide range of channel densities and kinetic parameters and examined which combinations of parameters maximized spiking function while minimizing energetic cost. We confirmed these results for sodium channels using a dynamic current clamp in neocortical fast spiking interneurons. We find further evidence supporting this hypothesis in a wide range of other neurons from several species and conclude that the ion channels in these neurons minimize energy expenditure in their normal range of spiking.},

	abstract = {Author Summary{\textless}p{\textgreater}Dynamic systems biology models typically involve many kinetic parameters, the quantitative determination of which has been a serious obstacle to using these models. Previous work showed for a particular model that useful predictions could be extracted from a fit long before the experimental data constrained the parameters, even to within orders of magnitude. This was attributed to a “sloppy” pattern in the model's parameter sensitivities; the sensitivity eigenvalues were roughly evenly spaced over many decades. Consequently, the model behavior depended effectively on only a few “stiff” parameter combinations. Here we study the converse problem, showing that direct parameter measurements are very inefficient at constraining the model's behavior. To yield effective predictions, such measurements must be very precise and complete; even a single imprecise parameter often destroys predictivity. We also show here that the characteristic sloppy eigenvalue pattern is reproduced in 16 other diverse models from the systems biology literature. The apparent universality of sloppiness suggests that predictions from most models will be very fragile to single uncertain parameters and that collective parameters fits can often yield tight predictions with loose parameters. Together these results argue that focusing on parameter values may be a very inefficient route to useful models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A dynamic model of the glycogenolytic pathway to lactate in skeletal muscle was constructed with mammalian kinetic parameters obtained from the literature. Energetic buffers relevant to muscle were included. The model design features stoichiometric constraints, mass balance, and fully reversible thermodynamics as defined by the Haldane relation. We employed a novel method of validating the thermodynamics of the model by allowing the closed system to come to equilibrium; the combined mass action ratio of the pathway equaled the product of the individual enzymes' equilibrium constants. Adding features physiologically relevant to muscle—a fixed glycogen concentration, efflux of lactate, and coupling to an ATPase—allowed for a steady-state flux far from equilibrium. The main result of our analysis is that coupling of the glycogenolytic network to the ATPase transformed the entire complex into an ATPase driven system. This steady-state system was most sensitive to the external ATPase activity and not to internal pathway mechanisms. The control distribution among the internal pathway enzymes—although small compared to control by ATPase—depended on the flux level and fraction of glycogen phosphorylase a. This model of muscle glycogenolysis thus has unique features compared to models developed for other cell types. © 2002 Biomedical Engineering Society. PAC2002: 8719Ff, 8239Fk, 8718Bb, 8714Ee},

	abstract = {We consider a system of equivalent, independent units each of which can exist in n states. Transitions between pairs of states follow unimolecular kinetics. Certain models for membrane transport provide examples. The states and allowed transitions, for any given model, can be represented by a basic diagram. Rate constants for the transitions are generally chosen so that the system reaches a non-equilibrium steady state at t = ∞. The population of the different states at steady state can be calculated by a diagram method. Similarly, diagrams may be used to find the steady state net flux between pairs of states. In particular, fluxes can be related to possible cycles in the basic diagram. The difference in products of rate constants around a cycle in opposite directions is related to a thermodynamic force. Hence flux-force equations follow from the diagram approach. These equations are applicable to arbitrary steady states; linear terms exhibit reciprocal relations. Near equilibrium, the conventional flux-force equations of irreversible thermodynamics obtain. The reciprocal relations are compounded from individual cycle reciprocal relations. The latter follow directly from the properties of cycles.},

The voltage dependence of the rate constants is derived from the elementary chargetranslocations associated with the single reaction steps. Charge displacements result from movements of the sodium- or potassium-loaded binding sites, as well as from motions of polar groups in the pump molecule. If part of the transmembrane voltage drops between the alkali-ion binding sites and the aqueous solution, the binding constants become voltage-dependent. Depending on the values of the microscopic parameters, the current-voltage characteristic may assume a variety of different shapes. Saturating behaviour results when one or more voltage-independent reaction steps become rate limiting. Non-monotonic current-voltage curves exhibiting regions of negative pump conductance are predicted when, at least in one of the transitions, charge is moved against the direction of overall charge-translocation. The theoretical predictions are compared with recent experimental studies of voltage-dependent pump currents.},

They should provide simple, general and biochemically plausible formulae for reaction velocities and reaction elasticities. At the same time, they need to respect thermodynamic relations between the kinetic constants and the metabolic fluxes and concentrations.
Results: We present a family of reversible rate laws for reactions with arbitrary stoichiometries and various types of regulation, including mass–action, Michaelis–Menten and uni–uni reversible Hill kinetics as special cases. With a thermodynamically safe parameterization of these rate laws, parameter sets obtained by model fitting, sampling or optimization are guaranteed to lead to consistent chemical equilibrium states. A reformulation using saturation values yields simple formulae for rates and elasticities, which can be easily adjusted to the given stationary flux distributions. Furthermore, this formulation highlights the role of chemical potential differences as thermodynamic driving forces. We compare the modular rate laws to the thermodynamic–kinetic modelling formalism and discuss a simplified rate law in which the reaction rate directly depends on the reaction affinity. For automatic handling of modular rate laws, we propose a standard syntax and semantic annotations for the Systems Biology Markup Language.

We first introduce closed networks “in a box”, whose thermodynamics is subjected to strict physical constraints: the mass-action law, elementarity of processes, and detailed balance. We further digress on the role of solvents and on the seemingly unacknowledged property of network independence of free energy landscapes. We then open the system by assuming that the concentrations of certain substrate species (the chemostats) are fixed, whether because promptly regulated by the environment via contact with reservoirs, or because nearly constant in a time window. As a result, the system is driven out of equilibrium. A rich algebraic and topological structure ensues in the network of internal species: Emergent irreversible cycles are associated with nonvanishing affinities, whose symmetries are dictated by the breakage of conservation laws. These central results are resumed in the relation a + b = s Y between the number of fundamental affinities a, that of broken conservation laws b and the number of chemostats s Y . We decompose the steady state entropy production rate in terms of fundamental fluxes and affinities in the spirit of Schnakenberg\&apos;s theory of network thermodynamics, paving the way for the forthcoming treatment of the linear regime, of efficiency and tight coupling, of free energy transduction, and of thermodynamic constraints for network reconstruction.},

Flux balance analysis (FBA) is based on the constraint of mass conservation; energy balance analysis (EBA) is based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The power of these approaches lies in the fact that the constraints are based on physical laws, and do not make use of unknown parameters. Here, we show that the network structure (i.e. the stoichiometric matrix) alone provides a system of constraints on the fluxes in a biochemical network which are feasible according to both mass balance and the laws of thermodynamics. A realistic example shows that these constraints can be sufficient for deriving unambiguous, biologically meaningful results. The thermodynamic constraints are obtained by comparing of the sign pattern of the flux vector to the sign patterns of the cycles of the internal cycle space via connection between stoichiometric network theory (SNT) and the mathematical theory of oriented matroids.},

For certain cases of such interaction reciprocal relations have been deduced by earlier writers, e.g., Thomson's theory of thermoelectric phenomena and Helmholtz' theory for the e.m.f. of electrolytic cells with liquid junction. These earlier derivations may be classed as quasi-thermodynamic; in fact, Thomson himself pointed out that his argument was incomplete, and that his relation ought to be established on an experimental basis. A general class of such relations will be derived by a new theoretical treatment from the principle of microscopic reversibility. (§§1-2.) The analogy with a chemical monomolecular triangle reaction is discussed; in this case a a simple kinetic consideration assuming microscopic reversibility yields a reciprocal relation that is not necessary for fulfilling the requirements of thermodynamics (§3). Reciprocal relations for heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are derived from the assumption of microscopic reversibility, applied to fluctuations. (§4.) The reciprocal relations can be expressed in terms of a potential, the dissipation-function. Lord Rayleigh's "principle of the least dissipation of energy" is generalized to include the case of anisotropic heat conduction. A further generalization is announced. (§5.) The conditions for stationary flow are formulated; the connection with earlier quasi-thermodynamic theories is discussed. (§6.)

	abstract = {Mass-action kinetics are used in chemistry and chemical engineering to describe the dynamics of systems of chemical reactions, that is, reaction networks. These models are a special form of compartmental systems, which involve mass- and energy-balance relations. Aside from their role in chemical engineering applications, mass-action kinetics have numerous analytical properties that are of inherent interest from a dynamical systems perspective. Because of physical considerations, however, mass- action kinetics have special properties, such as nonnegative solutions, that are useful for analyzing their behavior. With this motivation in mind, this article has several objectives. First, a general construction of the kinetic equations based on the reaction laws is provided in a state-space form. Next, the nonnegativity of solutions to the kinetic equations is considered. The realizability problem, which is concerned with the inverse problem of constructing a reaction network having specified essentially nonnegative dynamics, is also considered. In particular, an explicit construction of a reaction network for essentially nonnegative polynomial dynamics involving a scalar state is provided. Next, the reducibility of the kinetic equations is considered as well as the stability of the equilibria of the kinetic equations. Lyapunov methods are applied to the kinetic equations, and semistability is guaranteed through the convergence to a Lyapunov- stable equilibrium that depends on the initial concentrations. Semistability is the appropriate notion of stability for compartmental systems in general, and reaction networks in particular, where the limiting concentration maybe nonzero and may depend on the initial concentrations. Finally, the zero deficiency result for mass-action kinetics in standard matrix terminology is presented and semistability is proven.},

We apply ecological axioms to the construction of complex model ecologies. The axioms ensure realistic ecological properties and internal consistency of a broad class of models that encompass many theoretical and applied models. A key new analytical result for our dynamical systems in ecospace is that extinctions can be studied without knowledge of either interior equilibrium points or their stability. By looking only at boundary extinction points we can immediately comment on the extinction behaviour without solving for any of the dynamics. This is a striking simplification, and even holds when the dynamics are chaotic.

We demonstrate the approach by constructing three plankton ecosystem models that we designed to have specific properties and show that the effect of change on plankton blooms and/or extinctions depends on the properties of the model chosen for the simulation.},

	abstract = {The sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium transport ATPase (SERCA) is a pump that transports calcium ions from the cytoplasm into the SR. It is present in both animal and plant cells, although knowledge of SERCA in the latter is scant. The pump shares the catalytic properties of ion-motive ATPases of the P-type family, but has distinctive regulation properties. The SERCA pump is encoded by a family of three genes, SERCA1, 2, and 3, that are highly conserved but localized on different chromosomes. The SERCA isoform diversity is dramatically enhanced by alternative splicing of the transcripts, occurring mainly at the COOH-terminal. At present, more than 10 different SERCA isoforms have been detected at the protein level. These isoforms exhibit both tissue and developmental specificity, suggesting that they contribute to unique physiological properties of the tissue in which they are expressed. The function of the SERCA pump is modulated by the endogenous molecules phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN), expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. The mechanism of action of PLB on SERCA is well characterized, whereas that of SLN is only beginning to be understood. Because the SERCA pump plays a major role in muscle contraction, a number of investigations have focused on understanding its role in cardiac and skeletal muscle disease. These studies document that SERCA pump expression and activity are decreased in aging and in a variety of pathophysiological conditions including heart failure. Recently, SERCA pump gene transfer was shown to be effective in restoring contractile function in failing heart muscle, thus emphasizing its importance in muscle physiology and its potential use as a therapeutic agent.

	abstract = {The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of smooth muscles presents many intriguing facets and questions concerning its roles, especially as these change with development, disease, and modulation of physiological activity. The SR's function was originally perceived to be synthetic and then that of a Ca store for the contractile proteins, acting as a Ca amplification mechanism as it does in striated muscles. Gradually, as investigators have struggled to find a convincing role for Ca-induced Ca release in many smooth muscles, a role in controlling excitability has emerged. This is the Ca spark/spontaneous transient outward current coupling mechanism which reduces excitability and limits contraction. Release of SR Ca occurs in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, Ca, and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and depletion of SR Ca can initiate Ca entry, the mechanism of which is being investigated but seems to involve Stim and Orai as found in nonexcitable cells. The contribution of the elemental Ca signals from the SR, sparks and puffs, to global Ca signals, i.e., Ca waves and oscillations, is becoming clearer but is far from established. The dynamics of SR Ca release and uptake mechanisms are reviewed along with the control of luminal Ca. We review the growing list of the SR's functions that still includes Ca storage, contraction, and relaxation but has been expanded to encompass Ca homeostasis, generating local and global Ca signals, and contributing to cellular microdomains and signaling in other organelles, including mitochondria, lysosomes, and the nucleus. For an integrated approach, a review of aspects of the SR in health and disease and during development and aging are also included. While the sheer versatility of smooth muscle makes it foolish to have a “one model fits all” approach to this subject, we have tried to synthesize conclusions wherever possible.},

The advance of high-throughput technologies opens an invaluable opportunity to monitor the activity at diverse biological levels and elucidate how cancer originates, evolves and responds under drug treatments. To this end, researchers are confronted with two fundamental questions: how to interpret high-throughput data and how this information can contribute to the development of personalized treatment in patients. A variety of schemes in systems biology have been suggested to characterize the phenotypic states associated with cancer by utilizing computational modeling and high-throughput data. These theoretical schemes are distinguished by the level of complexity of the biological mechanisms that they represent and by the computational approaches used to simulate them. Notably, these theoretical approaches have provided a proper framework to explore some distinctive metabolic mechanisms observed in cancer cells such as the Warburg effect. In this review, we focus on presenting a general view of some of these approaches whose application and integration will be crucial in the transition from local to global conclusions in cancer studies. We are convinced that multidisciplinary approaches are required to construct the bases of an integrative and personalized medicine, which has been and remains a fundamental task in the medicine of this century.},

Principally, Ca2+ is the link between the electrical signals that pervade the heart and contraction of the myocytes to propel blood. In addition, Ca2+ controls numerous other myocyte activities, including gene transcription. Cardiac Ca2+ signaling essentially relies on a few critical molecular players—ryanodine receptors, voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, and Ca2+ pumps/transporters. These moieties are responsible for generating Ca2+ signals upon cellular depolarization, recovery of Ca2+ signals following cellular contraction, and setting basal conditions. Whereas these are the central players underlying cardiac Ca2+ fluxes, networks of signaling mechanisms and accessory proteins impart complex regulation on cardiac Ca2+ signals. Subtle changes in components of the cardiac Ca2+ signaling machinery, albeit through mutation, disease, or chronic alteration of hemodynamic demand, can have profound consequences for the function and phenotype of myocytes. Here, we discuss mechanisms underlying Ca2+ signaling in ventricular and atrial myocytes. In particular, we describe the roles and regulation of key participants involved in Ca2+ signal generation and reversal.},

	abstract = {Cell fate decisions during embryonic development and tumorigenesis pose a major research challenge in modern developmental and cancer biology. Binary cell fate decisions are usually regulated by gene circuits incorporating either classical toggle switches with two mutually inhibiting transcription factor (TF) genes or chimera toggle switches with a mutually inhibiting pair of microRNA (miRNA) and TF gene. These circuits can explain binary cell fate decisions. Importantly, intermediate cell types can exist during the differentiation of both stem cells and cancer cells. It has been shown that TF-TF self-activating toggle switches (SATS) can have coexistence of three metastable states (tristability), yet the role of chimera toggle switches in opening these additional states remains elusive. Here we present a generalized framework for both the TF-TF SATS and miRNA-TF chimera SATS, starting from the TF-promoter and miRNA-mRNA binding/unbinding dynamics. We show that the chimera SATSs can also have tristability. We demonstrate that the dynamics of miRNA-TF SATS is qualitatively different from that of the TF-TF SATS because the nonlinear effects of translational silencing by miRNA are distinct from those of transcriptional repression. We discuss the possible relevance of these findings to fate decisions by cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Realistic simulation of the kinetic properties of metabolic pathways requires rate equations to be expressed in reversible form, because substrate and product elasticities are drastically different in reversible and irreversible reactions. This presents no special problem for reactions that follow reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but for enzymes showing cooperative kinetics the full reversible rate equations are extremely complicated, and anyway in virtually all cases the full equations are unknown because suflciently complete kinetic studies have not been carried out. There is a need, therefore, for approximate reversible equations that allow convenient simulation without violating thermodynamic constraints.
Results: We show how the irreversible Hill equation can be generalized to a reversible form, including effects of modijiers. The proposed equation leads to behaviour virtually indistinguishable from that predicted by a kinetic form of the Adair equation, despite the fact that the latter is a far more complicated equation. By contrast, a reversible form of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux equation that has sometimes been used leads to predictions for the effects of modifiers at high substrate concentration that differ qualitatively from those given by the Adair equation.

But little is known about the dynamic properties, key rate-limiting steps as well as the stochastic noise in this pathway. Presently, a system-theoretic approach was presented to analyze and quantitative modeling of a generic miRNA pathway, which can be implemented deterministically and stochastically. Our results show that the inferred dynamic properties obtained from the mathematical models of the miRNA pathway are well consistent with previous experimental observations. By sensitivity analysis, the key steps in this pathway were found to be the miRNA gene transcription, RISC decay and mRNA formation. In addition, the results of quantified noise strength along the pathway demonstrate that the pathway can reduce the ingress noise and reveal the noise robustness property. Our findings also present testable hypothesis for experimental biologists to further investigate miRNA's increasing functional roles in regulating various cellular processes.},

	abstract = {Bioengineering analyses of physiological systems use the computational solution of physical conservation laws on anatomically detailed geometric models to understand the physiological function of intact organs in terms of the properties and behaviour of the cells and tissues within the organ. By linking behaviour in a quantitative, mathematically defined sense across multiple scales of biological organization – from proteins to cells, tissues, organs and organ systems – these methods have the potential to link patient-specific knowledge at the two ends of these spatial scales. A genetic profile linked to cardiac ion channel mutations, for example, can be interpreted in relation to body surface ECG measurements via a mathematical model of the heart and torso, which includes the spatial distribution of cardiac ion channels throughout the myocardium and the individual kinetics for each of the approximately 50 types of ion channel, exchanger or pump known to be present in the heart. Similarly, linking molecular defects such as mutations of chloride ion channels in lung epithelial cells to the integrated function of the intact lung requires models that include the detailed anatomy of the lungs, the physics of air flow, blood flow and gas exchange, together with the large deformation mechanics of breathing. Organizing this large body of knowledge into a coherent framework for modelling requires the development of ontologies, markup languages for encoding models, and web-accessible distributed databases. In this article we review the state of the field at all the relevant levels, and the tools that are being developed to tackle such complexity. Integrative physiology is central to the interpretation of genomic and proteomic data, and is becoming a highly quantitative, computer-intensive discipline.},

	abstract = {Cardiac rhythms arise from electrical activity generated by precisely timed opening and closing of ion channels in individual cardiac myocytes. These impulses spread throughout the cardiac muscle to manifest as electrical waves in the whole heart. Regularity of electrical waves is critically important since they signal the heart muscle to contract, driving the primary function of the heart to act as a pump and deliver blood to the brain and vital organs. When electrical activity goes awry during a cardiac arrhythmia, the pump does not function, the brain does not receive oxygenated blood, and death ensues. For more than 50 years, mathematically based models of cardiac electrical activity have been used to improve understanding of basic mechanisms of normal and abnormal cardiac electrical function. Computer-based modeling approaches to understand cardiac activity are uniquely helpful because they allow for distillation of complex emergent behaviors into the key contributing components underlying them. Here we review the latest advances and novel concepts in the field as they relate to understanding the complex interplay between electrical, mechanical, structural, and genetic mechanisms during arrhythmia development at the level of ion channels, cells, and tissues. We also discuss the latest computational approaches to guiding arrhythmia therapy.},

	abstract = {Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes – the epithelial to ­mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) – are hallmarks of cancer metastasis. While transitioning between the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, cells can also attain a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) (i.e., partial or intermediate EMT) phenotype. Cells in this phenotype have mixed epithelial (e.g., adhesion) and mesenchymal (e.g., migration) properties, thereby allowing them to move collectively as clusters. If these clusters reach the bloodstream intact, they can give rise to clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), as have often been seen experimentally. Here, we review the operating principles of the core regulatory network for EMT/MET that acts as a “three-way” switch giving rise to three distinct phenotypes – E, M and hybrid E/M – and present a theoretical framework that can elucidate the role of many other players in regulating epithelial plasticity. Furthermore, we highlight recent studies on partial EMT and its association with drug resistance and tumor-initiating potential; and discuss how cell–cell communication between cells in a partial EMT phenotype can enable the formation of clusters of CTCs. These clusters can be more apoptosis-resistant and have more tumor-initiating potential than singly moving CTCs with a wholly mesenchymal (complete EMT) phenotype. Also, more such clusters can be formed under inflammatory conditions that are often generated by various therapies. Finally, we discuss the multiple advantages that the partial EMT or hybrid E/M phenotype have as compared to a complete EMT phenotype and argue that these collectively migrating cells are the primary “bad actors” of metastasis.},

	abstract = {The importance of post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) has recently been recognized in almost all cellular processes. When participating in cellular processes, miRNAs mainly mediate mRNA degradation or translational repression. Recently computational and experimental studies have identified an abundance of motifs involving miRNAs and transcriptional factors (TFs). The simplest motif is a two-node miRNA-mediated feedback loop (MFL) in which a TF regulates an miRNA and the TF itself is negatively regulated by the miRNA. In this paper we present a general computational model for the MFL based on biochemical regulations and explore its dynamics by using bifurcation analysis. Our results show that the MFL can behave either as switches or as oscillators, depending on the TF as a repressor or an activator. These functional features are consistent with the widespread appearance of miRNAs in fate decisions such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during development. We found that under the interplay of a TF and an miRNA, the MFL model can behave as switches for wide ranges of parameters even without cooperative binding of the TF. In addition, oscillations induced by the miRNA in the MFL model require neither an additional positive feedback loop, nor self-activation of the gene, nor cooperative binding of the TF, nor saturated degradation. Therefore, the MFL may provide a general network structure to induce bistability or oscillations. It is hoped that the results presented here will provide a new view on how gene expression is regulated by miRNAs and further guidance for experiments. Moreover, the insight gained from this study is also expected to provide a basis for the investigation of more complex networks assembled by simple building blocks.},

	abstract = {It is estimated that maintenance of the resting potential of neurons consumes between 15 \% (in gray matter) and 44 \% (in fully myelinated white matter) of the brain’s total energy budget [1]. This poses the intriguing question why evolution has not strived to lower the permeability of passive ion channels to cut the high resting-state energy budget of the brain. Based on a conceptual mathematical model of neuronal ion currents and action potential (AP) firing we demonstrate that a neuron endowed with small leak currents and correspondingly low energy consumption by the Na+/K+-ATPase in the resting state may indeed recapitulate all features of normal AP firing. However, the activation and inactivation of such a “low-energy-cost neuron” turns out to be extremely sensitive to small fluctuation of Na+ currents associated with Na+-dependent secondary-active transport that is indispensable for the metabolic integrity of the cell and neurotransmitter recycling. We provide evidence that sufficiently large leak currents function as important stabilizers of the membrane potential and thus are required to allow robust AP firing. Our simulations suggest that the energy demand of the Na+/K+-ATPase needed to counterbalance passive leak currents cannot be significantly dropped below observed values.},

To this end, numerous biomolecular mechanisms exist that allow the sensing of the energetic state and corresponding adjustment of enzymatic reaction rates. This regulation is known to induce dynamic systems properties such as oscillations or perfect adaptation. Although the various mechanisms of energy regulation have been studied in detail from many angles at the experimental and theoretical levels, no framework is available for the systematic analysis of EM from a control systems perspective. In this study, we have used principles well known in control to clarify the basic system features that govern EM. The major result is a subdivision of the biomolecular mechanisms of energy regulation in terms of widely used engineering control mechanisms: proportional, integral, derivative control, and structures: feedback, cascade and feed-forward control. Evidence for each mechanism and structure is demonstrated and the implications for systems properties are shown through simulations. As the equivalence between biological systems and control components presented here is generic, it is also hypothesized that our work could eventually have an applicability that is much wider than the focus of the current study.},

	abstract = {Although the intracellular trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors controls specific signaling events, it is unclear how the spatiotemporal control of signaling contributes to complex pathophysiological processes such as inflammation. By using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and superresolution microscopy, we found that substance P (SP) induces the association of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) with two classes of proteins that regulate SP signaling from plasma and endosomal membranes: the scaffolding proteins β-arrestin (βARRs) 1 and 2 and the transmembrane metallopeptidases ECE-1c and ECE-1d. In HEK293 cells and non-transformed human colonocytes, we observed that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and βARR1/2 terminate plasma membrane Ca2+ signaling and initiate receptor trafficking to endosomes that is necessary for sustained activation of ERKs in the nucleus. βARRs deliver the SP-NK1R endosomes, where ECE-1 associates with the complex, degrades SP, and allows the NK1R, freed from βARRs, to recycle. Thus, both ECE-1 and βARRs mediate the resensitization of NK1R Ca2+ signaling at the plasma membrane. Sustained exposure of colonocytes to SP activates NF-κB and stimulates IL-8 secretion. This proinflammatory signaling is unaffected by inhibition of the endosomal ERK pathway but is suppressed by ECE-1 inhibition or βARR2 knockdown. Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A, which also contributes to sustained NK1R signaling at the plasma membrane, similarly attenuates IL-8 secretion. Thus, the primary function of βARRs and ECE-1 in SP-dependent inflammatory signaling is to promote resensitization, which allows the sustained NK1R signaling from the plasma membrane that drives inflammation.},

	abstract = {We present a metabolically regulated model of cardiac active force generation with which we investigate the effects of ischemia on maximum force production. Our model, based on a model of cross-bridge kinetics that was developed by others, reproduces many of the observed effects of MgATP, MgADP, Pi, and H+ on force development while retaining the force/length/Ca2+ properties of the original model. We introduce three new parameters to account for the competitive binding of H+ to the Ca2+ binding site on troponin C and the binding of MgADP within the cross-bridge cycle. These parameters, along with the Pi and H+ regulatory steps within the cross-bridge cycle, were constrained using data from the literature and validated using a range of metabolic and sinusoidal length perturbation protocols. The placement of the MgADP binding step between two strongly-bound and force-generating states leads to the emergence of an unexpected effect on the force-MgADP curve, where the trend of the relationship (positive or negative) depends on the concentrations of the other metabolites and [H+]. The model is used to investigate the sensitivity of maximum force production to changes in metabolite concentrations during the development of ischemia.},

	abstract = {The energy consumed during an action potential event must be replaced, ultimately by the metabolic system of the organism. As discussed by a number of authors, there is a trade-off between the speed of an action potential event and energy consumption and, moreover, this consumption can be optimised by adjusting ion channel density and gating time constants. The energy consumption is dependent on both species and type of neuron. The influx of Na is often taken as a proxy for energy consumption. For example, 3Na ions can be expelled using one ATP molecule within the sodium-potassium pump. Thus 1/3 of the Na can be taken as a proxy for energy consumption. In contrast, this paper presents an energy based model of action potentials and thus can be directly used to compute energy consumption in both healthy and diseased neurons. These results are illustrated by comparing the energy consumption of healthy and degenerative retinal ganglion cells using both simulated and in vitro data.},

	abstract = {A single entity, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphorylates and regulates in vivo hydroxymethylglutraryl-CoA reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (key regulatory enzymes of sterol synthesis and fatty acid synthesis, respectively), and probably many additional targets. The kinase is activated by high AMP and low ATP via a complex mechanism, which involves allosteric regulation, promotion of phosphorylation by an upstream protein kinase (AMPK kinase), and inhibition of dephosphorylation. This protein-kinase cascade represents a sensitive system, which is activated by cellular stresses that deplete ATP, and thus acts like a cellular fuel gauge. Our central hypothesis is that, when it detects a ‘low-fuel’ situation, it protects the cell by switching off ATP-consuming pathways (e.g. fatty acid synthesis and sterol synthesis) and switching on alternative pathways for ATP generation (e.g. fatty acid oxidation). Native AMP-activated protein kinase is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic α subunit, and β and γ subunits, which are also essential for activity. All three subunits have homologues in budding yeast, which are components of the SNF1 protein-kinase complex. SNF1 is activated by glucose starvation (which in yeast leads to ATP depletion) and genetic studies have shown that it is involved in derepression of glucose-repressed genes. This raises the intriguing possibility that AMPK may regulate gene expression in mammals. AMPK/SNF1 homologues are found in higher plants, and this protein-kinase cascade appears to be an ancient system which evolved to protect cells against the effects of nutritional or environmental stress.},

This is mainly due to the increasing role of the superfast relaxation processes with a characteristic time of about 0.1 ms. Mainly in order to explain this effect, Huxley and Simmons proposed their famous model of force generation in 1971. The present paper examines the effect of elasticity of filaments on relaxation processes. It is shown that if the filaments are not perfectly elastic, the superfast tension transient may result from a delay of redistribution of stresses within actin and/or myosin filaments at the beginning of phase 2. Corresponding redistribution of deformations within the actin filaments leads to non-uniform shifts of the attached myosin heads and changes in the X-ray diffraction pattern. Additionally, we discuss a change in the experimental technique that allows suppression of the elastic vibrations that obscure the contributions of other sources to the superfast tension transient.},

High resolution single molecule experiments can now observe motor protein movement with increasing precision. The emerging data must be combined with structural and kinetic measurements to develop a quantitative mechanism. This article describes a modelling framework where quantitative understanding of motor behaviour can be developed based on the protein structure. The framework is applied to myosin motors, with emphasis on how synchrony between motor domains give rise to processive unidirectional movement. The modelling approach shows that the elasticity of protein domains are important in regulating motor function. Simple models of protein domain elasticity are presented. The framework can be generalized to other motor systems, or an ensemble of motors such as muscle contraction. Indeed, for hundreds of myosins, our framework can be reduced to the Huxely–Simmons description of muscle movement in the mean-field limit.},

The model presented here includes the functional description of a cardiomyocyte (cellular scale), which explains the dynamic behaviour of the calcium concentration within the cell whilst an action potential develops. The cell domain is coupled to a domain that determines the kinetics of the sliding filament mechanism (protein level), which is at the basis of cardiac contraction. These processes are then linked to the generation of muscular force and from there to the generation of pressure inside the ventricle. This multi-scale model presents a coherent and unified way to describe cardiac contraction from the protein to the organ level.},

	abstract = {The cross-bridge working stroke is regarded as a continuous (without jumps) change of myosin head internal state under the action of a force exerted within the nucleotide-binding site. Involvement of a concept of continuous cross-bridge conformation enables discussion of the nature of the force propelling muscle, and the Coulomb repulsion of like-charged adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fragments ADP2− and P i 2− can quite naturally be considered as the source of this force. Two entirely different types of working stroke termination are considered. Along with the fluctuation mechanism, which controls the working stroke duration t w at isometric contraction, another interrupt mechanism is initially taken into account. It is triggered when the lever arm shift amounts to the maximal value S ≈ 11 nm, the back door opens, and Pi crashes out. As a result, t w becomes inversely proportional to the velocity v of sliding filaments t w ≈ S/v for a wide range of values of v. Principal features of the experimentally observed dependences of force, efficiency, and rate of heat production on velocity and ATP concentration can then be reproduced by fitting a single parameter: the velocity-independent time span t r between the termination of the last and beginning of the next working stroke. v becomes the principal variable of the model, and the muscle force changes under external load are determined by variations in v rather than in the tension of filaments. The Boltzmann equation for an ensemble of cross-bridges is obtained, and some collective effects are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND To investigate whether altered cross-bridge kinetics contribute to the contractile abnormalities observed in heart failure, we determined the mechanical properties of cardiac muscles from control and myopathic hearts.
METHODS AND RESULTS Muscle fibers from normal (n = 5) and dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 6) hearts were obtained and chemically skinned with saponin. The muscles were then maximally activated at saturating calcium concentrations. Unloaded shortening velocities (V0) were determined in both groups. V0 in control was 0.72 +/- 0.09 Lmax/sec, whereas in myopathic muscles, V0 was 0.41 +/- 0.06 Lmax/sec at 22 degrees C. The muscles were also sinusoidally oscillated at frequencies ranging between 0.01 and 100 Hz. The dynamic stiffness of the muscles was calculated from the ratio of force response amplitude to length oscillation amplitude. At low frequencies ({\textless} 0.2 Hz) the stiffness was constant but was larger in myopathic muscles. In the range of 0.2-1 Hz, there was a drop in the magnitude of dynamic stiffness to approximately one quarter of the low-frequency baseline. This range reflects cross-bridge turnover kinetics. In control muscles, the frequency of minimum stiffness was 0.78 +/- 0.06 Hz, whereas it was 0.42 +/- 0.07 Hz in myopathic muscles. At higher frequencies, the dynamic stiffness increased and reached a plateau at 30 Hz. There were no differences in the plateau reached between control and myopathic muscles.
CONCLUSIONS Because myopathic hearts have a markedly diminished energy reserve, the slowing of the cross-bridge cycling rate plays an important adaptational role in the observed contractility changes in human heart failure. Although the potential to generate maximal Ca(2+)-activated force is similar in normal and myopathic hearts, alterations in contractile protein composition could explain the diminished cross-bridge cycling rate in failing hearts.},

	abstract = {Molecular motors are first and foremost molecules, governed by the laws of chemistry rather than of mechanics. The dynamical behavior of motors based on chemical principles can be described as a random walk on a network of states. A key insight is that any molecular motor in solution explores all possible motions and configurations at thermodynamic equilibrium. By using input energy and chemical design to prevent motion that is not wanted, what is left behind is the motion that is desired. This review is focused on two-headed motors such as kinesin and Myosin V that move on a polymeric track. By use of microscopic reversibility, it is shown that the ratio between the number of forward steps and the number of backward steps in any sufficiently long time period does not directly depend on the mechanical properties of the linker between the two heads. Instead, this ratio is governed by the relative chemical specificity of the heads in the front-versus-rear position for the fuel, adenosine triphosphate and its products, adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate. These insights have been key factors in the design of biologically inspired synthetic molecular walkers constructed out of DNA or out of small organic molecules.},

	abstract = {The responses of muscle to steady and stepwise shortening are simulated with a model in which actin-myosin cross-bridges cycle through two pathways distinct for the attachment-detachment kinetics and for the proportion of energy converted into work. Small step releases and steady shortening at low velocity (high load) favor the cycle implying approximately 5 nm sliding per cross-bridge interaction and approximately 100/s detachment-reattachment process; large step releases and steady shortening at high velocity (low load) favor the cycle implying approximately 10 nm sliding per cross-bridge interaction and approximately 20/s detachment-reattachment process. The model satisfactorily predicts specific mechanical properties of frog skeletal muscle, such as the rate of regeneration of the working stroke as measured by double-step release experiments and the transition to steady state during multiple step releases (staircase shortening). The rate of energy liberation under different mechanical conditions is correctly reproduced by the model. During steady shortening, the relation of energy liberation rate versus shortening speed attains a maximum (approximately 6 times the isometric rate) for shortening velocities lower than half the maximum velocity of shortening and declines for higher velocities. In addition, the model provides a clue for explaining how, in different muscle types, the higher the isometric maintenance heat, the higher the power output during steady shortening.},

	abstract = {We develop a point model of the cardiac myofilament (MF) to simulate a wide variety of experimental muscle characterizations including Force-Ca relations and twitches under isometric, isosarcometric, isotonic, and auxotonic conditions. Complex MF behaviors are difficult to model because spatial interactions cannot be directly implemented as ordinary differential equations. We therefore allow phenomenological approximations with careful consideration to the relationships with the underlying biophysical mechanisms. We describe new formulations that avoid mean-field approximations found in most existing MF models. To increase the scope and applicability of the model, we include length- and temperature-dependent effects that play important roles in MF responses. We have also included a representation of passive restoring forces to simulate isolated cell shortening protocols. Possessing both computational efficiency and the ability to simulate a wide variety of muscle responses, the MF representation is well suited for coupling to existing cardiac cell models of electrophysiology and Ca-handling mechanisms. To illustrate this suitability, the MF model is coupled to the Chicago rabbit cardiomyocyte model. The combined model generates realistic appearing action potentials, intracellular Ca transients, and cell shortening signals. The combined model also demonstrates that the feedback effects of force on Ca binding to troponin can modify the cytosolic Ca transient.},

The dependency of ATP utilization and isometric force on [MgATP] was studied in skinned rat trabeculae under normal (pH 7.0) and simulated ischaemic (pH 6.2, 30 mM added Pi) conditions at 20±1 °C. At saturating [Ca2+], mean (±SEM) ATP utilization at 5 mM MgATP (A 0) was 0.48±0.03 mM/s and force (F 0) was 37±2 kN/m2. At 10 µM MgATP under normal conditions ATP utilization decreased gradually to 66±3\% of A 0 , and force increased to 169±7\% of F 0. Under ischaemic conditions at 10 µM MgATP, ATP utilization decreased from 30±5\% to 11±2\% of A 0 whereas force increased eightfold from 12±4\% to 97±7\% of F 0. The [MgATP] at half-maximal ATP utilization (K m) under ischaemic conditions was 21±3 µM. At pH 7.0, K m was estimated to be less than 10 µM. These results show that tension cost decreases markedly with decreasing MgATP. Under ischaemic conditions parallel changes in Ca2+ sensitivity of force and ATP utilization were observed, corresponding to 1.3 pCa units. Reducing [MgATP] from 0.5 to 0.05 mM caused a modest reversal of this change in Ca2+ sensitivity. These changes in Ca2+ sensitivity are consistent with a marked reduction in active force and force-related ATP utilization during ischaemia but are insufficient to explain the ischaemic contracture on the basis of active force development.},

In tracing this history from the late 19th century to the present, it becomes clear that energy can be (at least transiently) stored in a muscle undergoing an eccentric contraction but that this is unlikely to be due to the regeneration of ATP.

	abstract = {In muscle, work is performed by myosin cross-bridges during interactions with actin filaments. The amount of work performed during each interaction can be related to the mechanical properties of the cross-bridge; work is the integral of the force produced with respect to the distance that the cross-bridge moves the actin filament, and force is determined by the stiffness of the attached cross-bridge. In this paper, cross-bridge stiffness in frog sartorius muscle was estimated from thermodynamic efficiency (work/free energy change) using a two-state cross-bridge model, assuming constant stiffness over the working range and tight-coupling between cross- bridge cycles and ATP use. This model accurately predicts mechanical efficiency (work/enthalpy output). A critical review of the literature indicates that a realistic value for maximum thermodynamic efficiency of frog sartorius is 0.45 under conditions commonly used in experiments on isolated muscle. Cross-bridge stiffness was estimated for a range of power stroke amplitudes. For realistic amplitudes (10–15nm), estimated cross-bridge stiffness was between 1 and 2.2pNnm−1. These values are similar to those estimated from quick-release experiments, taking into account compliance arising from structures other than cross-bridges, but are substantially higher than those from isolated protein studies. The effects on stiffness estimates of relaxing the tight-coupling requirement and of incorporating more force-producing cross-bridge states are also considered.},

	abstract = {Myocardial calcium signalling is a vital component of the normal physiological function of the heart. Key amongst the many roles calcium plays is its use as the primary signalling component of excitation–contraction coupling, the intracellular process that links cardiomyocyte depolarisation to contraction. Defective cellular calcium handling, due to abnormalities of the various components which mediate and control excitation–contraction coupling, is widely recognised as a significant patho-physiological event in the contractile dysfunction of the failing heart. In addition, similar defects also appear to be increasingly recognised as mediators of certain forms of cardiac arrhythmias. Such defects include single gene defects in excitation–contraction coupling components that lead to inherited sudden death arrhythmia syndromes. Alternatively, arrhythmogenesis occurring within the context of acquired cardiac disease, in particular heart failure, also appears to be highly dependent on abnormal calcium homeostasis. In this article we review the defects in cardiomyocyte calcium homeostasis that lead to particular pro-arrhythmogenic phenomena and discuss recent insights gained into a variety of inherited and acquired arrhythmia syndromes that appear to involve defective calcium signalling as a central component of their patho-physiology. Potential opportunities for new anti arrhythmic therapeutic strategies based on these recent insights are also discussed.},

Stimulated by calcium signals, NFAT is translocated to the nucleus where it can regulate hypertrophic genes (excitation-transcription coupling). In excitable cells, such as myocytes, calcium is a key second messenger for multiple signaling events, including excitation-contraction coupling. Whether the calcium signals due to excitation-contraction and excitation-transcription coupling coincide or how they can be differentiated is currently unclear. Here we construct a mathematical model of NFAT cycling fitted to skeletal myocyte and baby hamster kidney cell data. The model replicates key behavior with respect to sensitivity to calcineurin overexpression and to calcium oscillations. Finally, we measure the sensitivity of the system to a simulated hypertrophic calcium signal, against a background excitation-contraction coupling calcium oscillation. We find that NFAT cycling is sensitive to excitation-transcription coupling even when both calcium signals are in the same cellular compartment, thus showing that separation of the signals may not be necessary in vitro.},

	abstract = {A molecular motor is made of either a single macromolecule or a macromolecular complex. Just like their macroscopic counterparts, molecular motors “transduce” input energy into mechanical work. All the nano-motors considered here operate under isothermal conditions far from equilibrium. Moreover, one of the possible mechanisms of energy transduction, called Brownian ratchet, does not even have any macroscopic counterpart. But, molecular motor is not synonymous with Brownian ratchet; a large number of molecular motors execute a noisy power stroke, rather than operating as Brownian ratchet. We review not only the structural design and stochastic kinetics of individual single motors, but also their coordination, cooperation and competition as well as the assembly of multi-module motors in various intracellular kinetic processes. Although all the motors considered here execute mechanical movements, efficiency and power output are not necessarily good measures of performance of some motors. Among the intracellular nano-motors, we consider the porters, sliders and rowers, pistons and hooks, exporters, importers, packers and movers as well as those that also synthesize, manipulate and degrade “macromolecules of life”. We review mostly the quantitative models for the kinetics of these motors. We also describe several of those motor-driven intracellular stochastic processes for which quantitative models are yet to be developed. In part I, we discuss mainly the methodology and the generic models of various important classes of molecular motors. In part II, we review many specific examples emphasizing the unity of the basic mechanisms as well as diversity of operations arising from the differences in their detailed structure and kinetics.

The ATPase site is the analogue of an engine and hydrolysis of ATP is the analogue of burning of chemical fuel. Moreover, the functional role of a segment of the motor is analogous to that of the transmission system of an automobile, which consists of a shaft, gear, clutch, etc. The operation of the engine is intrinsically ‘noisy’ and the motor faces a molecular ‘hailstorm’ in the aqueous medium. In this commemorative review, we celebrate the centenary of Michaelis and Menten's landmark paper of 1913 and the golden jubilee of Monod and colleagues classic paper of 1963 by highlighting their relevance with respect to explaining the operational mechanisms of the engine and the transmission system, respectively, of cytoskeletal motors.},

	abstract = {The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) plays a central role in regulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and myocardial contractility. Several studies show that improving Ca2+ handling in hypertrophied rodent hearts by increasing SERCA activity results in enhanced contractile function. This suggests that SERCA is a potential target for gene therapy in cardiac hypertrophy and failure. However, it raises the issue of increased energy cost resulting from a higher ATPase activity. In this study, we determined whether SERCA overexpression alters the energy cost of increasing myocardial contraction in mouse hearts with pressure-overload hypertrophy using 31P NMR spectroscopy. We isolated and perfused mouse hearts from wild-type (WT) and transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing the cardiac isoform of SERCA (SERCA2a) 8 weeks after ascending aortic constriction (left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)) or sham operation. We found that overexpressing SERCA2a enhances myocardial contraction and relaxation in normal mouse hearts during inotropic stimulation with isoproterenol. Energy consumption was proportionate to the increase in contractile function. Thus, increasing SERCA2a expression in the normal heart allows an enhanced inotropic response with no compromise in energy supply and demand. However, this advantage was not sustained in LVH hearts in which the energetic status was compromised. Although the overexpression of SERCA2a prevented the down-regulation of SERCA protein in LVH hearts, TG-LVH hearts showed no increase in inotropic response when compared with WT-LVH hearts. Our results suggest that energy supply may be a limiting factor for the benefit of SERCA overexpression in hypertrophied hearts. Thus, strategies combining energetic support with increasing SERCA activity may improve the therapeutic effectiveness for heart failure.},

	abstract = {The cardiac isoform of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a) is a calcium ion (Ca2+) pump powered by ATP hydrolysis. SERCA2a transfers Ca2+ from the cytosol of the cardiomyocyte to the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle relaxation. As such, this transporter has a key role in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ regulation. In both experimental models and human heart failure, SERCA2a expression is significantly decreased, which leads to abnormal Ca2+ handling and a deficient contractile state. Following a long line of investigations in isolated cardiac myocytes and small and large animal models, a clinical trial is underway that is restoring SERCA2a expression in patients with heart failure by use of adeno-associated virus type 1. Beyond its role in contractile abnormalities in heart failure, SERCA2a overexpression has beneficial effects in a host of other cardiovascular diseases. Here we describe the mechanism of Ca2+ regulation by SERCA2a, examine the beneficial effects as well as the failures, risks and complexities associated with SERCA2a overexpression, and discuss the potential of SERCA2a as a target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {The Ca2+ + Mg2+-activated ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum exhibits complex kinetics of activation with respect to ATP. ATPase activity is pH-dependent, with similar pH-activity profiles at high and low concentrations of ATP. Low concentrations of Ca2+ in the micromolar range activate the ATPase, whereas activity is inhibited by Ca2+ at millimolar concentrations. The pH-dependence of this Ca2+ inhibition and the effect of the detergent C12E8 (dodecyl octaethylene glycol monoether) on Ca2+ inhibition are similar to those observed on activation by low concentrations of Ca2+. On the basis of these and other studies we present a kinetic model for the ATPase. The ATPase is postulated to exist in one of two conformations: a conformation (E1) of high affinity for Ca2+ and MgATP and a conformation (E2) of low affinity for Ca2+ and MgATP. Ca2+ binding to E2 and to the phosphorylated form E2P are equal. Proton binding at the Ca2+-binding sites in the E1 and E2 conformations explains the pH-dependence of Ca2+ effects. Binding of MgATP to the phosphorylated intermediate E1'PCa2 and to E2 modulate the rates of the transport step E1'PCa-E2'PCa2 and the return of the empty Ca2+ sites to the outside surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as well as the rate of dephosphorylation of E2P. Only a single binding site for MgATP is postulated.},

A COS-1 cell expression system was used to examine the biochemical properties of the isoforms: SERCA1 (fast-twitch skeletal muscle). SERCA2a (cardiac/slow-twitch skeletal muscle), SERCA2b (ubiquitous smooth- and non-muscle), and SERCA3 (non-muscle). Each isoform was expressed efficiently and appeared to be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. All isoforms displayed qualitatively similar enzymatic properties and were activated by calcium in a cooperative manner with a Hill coefficient of 2. The quantitative properties of SERCA1 and SERCA2a (the muscle isoforms) were identical in all respects. SERCA2b, however, appeared to have a lower turnover rate for both calcium transport and ATP hydrolysis. SERCA3 displayed a reduced apparent affinity for calcium, an increased apparent affinity for vanadate, and an altered pH dependence when compared with the other isoforms. These properties are consistent with an enzyme in which the equilibrium between the E1 and E2 conformations is shifted toward the E2 state.},

	abstract = {Constraint-based modeling has proven to be a useful tool in the analysis of biochemical networks. To date, most studies in this field have focused on the use of linear constraints, resulting from mass balance and capacity constraints, which lead to the definition of convex solution spaces. One additional constraint arising out of thermodynamics is known as the “loop law” for reaction fluxes, which states that the net flux around a closed biochemical loop must be zero because no net thermodynamic driving force exists. The imposition of the loop-law can lead to nonconvex solution spaces making the analysis of the consequences of its imposition challenging. A four-step approach is developed here to apply the loop-law to study metabolic network properties: 1), determine linear equality constraints that are necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) for thermodynamic feasibility; 2), tighten Vmax and Vmin constraints to enclose the remaining nonconvex space; 3), uniformly sample the convex space that encloses the nonconvex space using standard Monte Carlo techniques; and 4), eliminate from the resulting set all solutions that violate the loop-law, leaving a subset of steady-state solutions. This subset of solutions represents a uniform random sample of the space that is defined by the additional imposition of the loop-law. This approach is used to evaluate the effect of imposing the loop-law on predicted candidate states of the genome-scale metabolic network of Helicobacter pylori.},

These responses are mediated by load-bearing subcellular structures, such as the plasma membrane, cell-adhesion complexes and the cytoskeleton. Recent work has demonstrated that these structures are dynamic, undergoing assembly, disassembly and movement, even when ostensibly stable. An emerging insight is that transduction of forces into biochemical signals occurs within the context of these processes. This framework helps to explain how forces of varying strengths or dynamic characteristics regulate distinct signalling pathways.

	abstract = {Despite extensive study over the past six decades the coupling of chemical reaction and mechanical processes in muscle dynamics is not well understood. We lack a theoretical description of how chemical processes (metabolite binding, ATP hydrolysis) influence and are influenced by mechanical processes (deformation and force generation). To address this need, a mathematical model of the muscle cross-bridge (XB) cycle based on Huxley's sliding filament theory is developed that explicitly accounts for the chemical transformation events and the influence of strain on state transitions. The model is identified based on elastic and viscous moduli data from mouse and rat myocardial strips over a range of perturbation frequencies, and MgATP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations. Simulations of the identified model reproduce the observed effects of MgATP and MgADP on the rate of force development. Furthermore, simulations reveal that the rate of force re-development measured in slack–restretch experiments is not directly proportional to the rate of XB cycling. For these experiments, the model predicts that the observed increase in the rate of force generation with increased Pi concentration is due to inhibition of cycle turnover by Pi. Finally, the model captures the observed phenomena of force yielding suggesting that it is a result of rapid detachment of stretched attached myosin heads.},

	abstract = {The study of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) function has shown to provide useful indicators for risk stratification and early detection on a variety of cardiovascular pathologies. However, data gathered during different tests of the ANS are difficult to analyse, mainly due to the complex mechanisms involved in the autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system (CVS). Although model-based analysis of ANS data has been already proposed as a way to cope with this complexity, only a few models coupling the main elements involved have been presented in the literature. In this paper, a new model of the CVS, representing the ventricles, the circulatory system and the regulation of the CVS activity by the ANS, is presented. The models of the vascular system and the ventricular activity have been developed using the Bond Graph formalism, as it proposes a unified representation for all energetic domains, facilitating the integration of mechanic and hydraulic phenomena. In order to take into account the electro-mechanical behaviour of both ventricles, an electrophysiologic model of the cardiac action potential, represented by a set of ordinary differential equations, has been integrated. The short-term ANS regulation of heart rate, cardiac contractility and peripheral vasoconstriction is represented by means of continuous transfer functions. These models, represented in different continuous formalisms, are coupled by using a multi-formalism simulation library. Results are presented for two different autonomic tests, namely the Tilt Test and the Valsalva Manoeuvre, by comparing real and simulated signals.},

	abstract = {We recently generated a transgenic (TG) mouse model in which the fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a) is overexpressed in the heart. Ectopic overexpression of SERCA1a results in remodeling of the cardiac SR containing 80\% SERCA1a and 20\% endogenous SERCA2a with an ∼2.5-fold increase in the total amount of SERCA protein (E. Loukianov et al. Circ. Res. 83: 889–897, 1998). We have analyzed the Ca2+ transport properties of membranes from SERCA1a TG hearts in comparison to control hearts. Our data show that the maximal velocity of SR Ca2+ transport was significantly increased (∼1.9-fold) in TG hearts, whereas the apparent affinity of the SERCA pump for Ca2+ was not changed. Addition of phospholamban antibody in the Ca2+ uptake assays increased the apparent affinity for Ca2+ to the same extent in TG and non-TG (NTG) hearts, suggesting that phospholamban regulates the SERCA1a pump in TG hearts. Analysis of SERCA enzymatic properties in TG hearts revealed that the SERCA pump affinity for ATP, the Hill coefficient, the pH dependence of Ca2+ uptake, and the effect of acidic pH on Ca2+ transport were similar to those of NTG hearts. Interestingly, the rate constant of phosphoenzyme decay (turnover rate of SERCA enzyme) was also very similar between TG and NTG hearts. Together these findings suggest that1) the SERCA1a pump can functionally substitute for SERCA2a and is regulated by endogenous phospholamban in the heart and 2) SERCA1a exhibits several enzymatic properties similar to those of SERCA2a when expressed in a cardiac setting.},

Specifically, inclusion of pace making mechanism has become much easier. The pace making mechanism is not, however, included in this stage of model development. Modular sources of effort are, instead, predicted in the model to generate synthetic signals close to what occurs in reality. The model is simulated and results of simulation are compared with widely available data of normal cardiovascular system's pressure-flow performance. It has been shown that they are of a good agreement and the model could successfully simulate performance of the human cardiovascular system},

Instead the myosin head produces force several hundreds of milliseconds after bound nucleotide is released.

	abstract = {A key step in the processive motion of two–headed kinesin along a microtubule is the ‘docking’ of the neck linker that joins each kinesin head to the motor's dimerized coiled–coil neck. This process is similar to the folding of a protein β–hairpin, which starts in a highly mobile unfolded state that has significant entropic elasticity and finishes in a more rigid folded state. We therefore suggest that neck–linker docking is mechanically equivalent to the thermally activated shortening of a spring that has been stretched by an applied load. This critical tension–dependent step utilizes Brownian motion and it immediately follows the binding of ATP, the hydrolysis of which provides the free energy that drives the kinesin cycle. A simple three–state model incorporating neck–linker docking can account quantitatively for both the kinesin force–velocity relation and the unusual tension–dependence of its Michaelis constant. However, we find that the observed randomness of the kinesin motor requires a more detailed four–state model. Monte Carlo simulations of single–molecule stepping with this model illustrate the possibility of sub–8 nm steps, the size of which is predicted to vary linearly with the applied load.},

It is essential in this mechanism for the moving head of kinesin to dissociate, while the other head remains firmly attached to the microtubule. Here we propose an alternative Brownian motor model where the action of ATP modulates the interaction potential between kinesin and the microtubule rather than a spring internal to the kinesin molecule alone. In this model neither head need dissociate (which predicts that under some circumstances a single–headed kinesin can display processive motion) and the transitions by which the motor moves are best described as thermally activated steps. This model is consistent with a wide range of experimental data on the force–velocity curves, the one ATP to one–step stoichiometry observed at small load, and the stochastic properties of the stepping.},

However, the relative effect of Parv and SERCA2a on systolic function and on β-adrenergic responsiveness at varied pacing rates is unknown. We used gene transfer in isolated rat adult cardiac myocytes to gain a fuller understanding of Parv/SERCA2a function. As demonstrated previously, when Parv is expressed in elevated concentration ({\textgreater}0.1 mM), the transduced myocytes showed a reduction in sarcomere-shortening amplitude: 129 ± 17, 81 ± 8, and 149 ± 14 nm for control, Parv, and SERCA2a, respectively. At physiological temperature, shortening amplitude responses of Parv and SERCA2a myocytes to the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (Iso) were not statistically different from that of control myocytes. However, in SERCA2a myocytes, in which baseline was slightly elevated and the Iso-stimulated value was slightly lower, the increase in shortening was slightly less than in Parv or control myocytes: 108 ± 14, 169 ± 39, and 34 ± 12\% for control, Parv, and SERCA2a, respectively. In another test set, Parv myocytes had the strongest early postrest potentiation among all groups studied (rest time = 2–10 s), and SERCA2a myocytes were the least sensitive to variations in stimulation rhythm. To replicate the deficient Ca2+ removal observed in heart failure, we used 150 nM thapsigargin. Under these conditions, control myocytes exhibited slowed relaxation, whereas Parv myocytes retained their rapid kinetics, showing that Parv is still able to control relaxation, even when SERCA2a function is impaired.},

	abstract = {Experimental studies have shown that the activity of the reconstituted molecular pump Ca2+-ATPase strongly depends on the thickness of the supporting bilayer. It is thus expected that the bilayer structure will have an impact on the thermodynamic efficiency of this nanomachine. Here, we introduce a nonequilibrium-thermodynamics theoretical approach to estimate the thermodynamic efficiency of the Ca2+-ATPase from analysis of available experimental data about ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport. We find that the entropy production, i.e., the heat released to the surroundings under working conditions, is approximately constant for bilayers containing phospholipids with hydrocarbon chains of 18–22 carbon atoms. Our estimates for the heat released during the pump operation agree with results obtained from separate calorimetric experiments on the Ca2+-ATPase derived from sarcoplasmic reticulum. We show that the thermodynamic efficiency of the reconstituted Ca2+-ATPase reaches a maximum for bilayer thicknesses corresponding to maximum activity. Surprisingly, the estimated thermodynamic efficiency is very low, ∼12\%. We discuss the significance of this result as representative of the efficiency of other nanomachines, and we address the influence of the experimental set-up on such a low efficiency. Overall, our approach provides a general route to estimate thermodynamic efficiencies and heat dissipation in experimental studies of nanomachines.},

The mechanism of the interaction between CSCs and MTs, and the cellular determinants that control the delivery of CSCs at the PM, are not yet well understood. We identified a unique small molecule, CESA TRAFFICKING INHIBITOR (CESTRIN), which reduces cellulose content and alters the anisotropic growth of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hypocotyls. We monitored the distribution and mobility of fluorescently labeled cellulose synthases (CESAs) in live Arabidopsis cells under chemical exposure to characterize their subcellular effects. CESTRIN reduces the velocity of PM CSCs and causes their accumulation in the cell cortex. The CSC-associated proteins KORRIGAN1 (KOR1) and POM2/CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE PROTEIN1 (CSI1) were differentially affected by CESTRIN treatment, indicating different forms of association with the PM CSCs. KOR1 accumulated in bodies similar to CESA; however, POM2/CSI1 dissociated into the cytoplasm. In addition, MT stability was altered without direct inhibition of MT polymerization, suggesting a feedback mechanism caused by cellulose interference. The selectivity of CESTRIN was assessed using a variety of subcellular markers for which no morphological effect was observed. The association of CESAs with vesicles decorated by the trans-Golgi network-localized protein SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS61 (SYP61) was increased under CESTRIN treatment, implicating SYP61 compartments in CESA trafficking. The properties of CESTRIN compared with known CESA inhibitors afford unique avenues to study and understand the mechanism under which PM-associated CSCs are maintained and interact with MTs and to dissect their trafficking routes in etiolated hypocotyls.},

Pharmaceutical and genetic studies have provided indications for interdependent cross-talk between the cytoskeletal components. Recent live-cell imaging studies have cemented this notion, in particular when the cytoskeleton rearranges. However, the proteins that directly mediate this cross-talk have remained largely elusive. Recent data indicate that certain proteins can interact with both cytoskeletal arrays at the same time, and hence connecting them. In this review, we summarize the recent literature of the AF- and MT-interactors, mainly focusing on a plant-specific mediator of cytoskeletal cross-talk: the calponin homology (CH) domain-containing kinesin-14 motor proteins (KCHs).},

While individual molecular mechanisms underpinning actin and MT dynamics have been intensively studied, principles that govern the cytoskeleton organization remain largely unexplored. Here, we captured biologically relevant characteristics of the plant cytoskeleton through a network-driven imaging-based approach allowing us to quantitatively assess dynamic features of the cytoskeleton. By introducing suitable null models, we demonstrate that the plant cytoskeletal networks exhibit properties required for efficient transport, namely, short average path lengths and high robustness. We further show that these advantageous features are maintained during temporal cytoskeletal rearrangements. Interestingly, man-made transportation networks exhibit similar properties, suggesting general laws of network organization supporting diverse transport processes. The proposed network-driven analysis can be readily used to identify organizational principles of cytoskeletons in other organisms.},

	abstract = {Plant stature and development are governed by cell proliferation and directed cell growth. These parameters are determined largely by cell wall characteristics. Cellulose microfibrils, composed of hydrogen-bonded β-1,4 glucans, are key components for anisotropic growth in plants. Cellulose is synthesized by plasma membrane–localized cellulose synthase complexes. In higher plants, these complexes are assembled into hexameric rosettes in intracellular compartments and secreted to the plasma membrane. Here, the complexes typically track along cortical microtubules, which may guide cellulose synthesis, until the complexes are inactivated and/or internalized. Determining the regulatory aspects that control the behavior of cellulose synthase complexes is vital to understanding directed cell and plant growth and to tailoring cell wall content for industrial products, including paper, textiles, and fuel. In this review, we summarize and discuss cellulose synthesis and regulatory aspects of the cellulose synthase complex, focusing on Arabidopsis thaliana.},

That the parallel relation between cortical microtubules and extracellular microfibrils is causal has been named the alignment hypothesis.

The other end of the microtubule makes contact with a surface sparsely coated with kinesin. By imaging the tip of the glass fiber on a photodiode detector, displacement of the microtubule by kinesin through as little as 1 nm can be detected and forces as small as 1 pN resolved. Using this force-fiber apparatus we have characterized the mechanical output of this molecular motor. The speed at which a molecule of kinesin moved along the surface of a microtubule decreased linearly as the elastic force was increased. The force required to stop a single kinesin molecule was 5.4 +/- 1.0 pN (mean +/- SD; n = 16), independent of the stiffness of the fiber, the damping from the fluid, and whether the ATP concentration was high or low.},

Cellulose microfibrils are synthesized and assembled by membrane‐localized protein complexes that are visualized as rosettes by freeze‐fracture electron microscopy. Cellulose synthase is required for cellulose synthesis. So far only this enzyme has been localized to these cellulose‐synthesizing complexes. Although it has not been possible to purify and fully characterize cellulose synthase activity from plants, it has been possible to obtain cellulose synthesis in vitro using membranes and detergent‐solubilized membrane fractions. Cellulose synthase uses uridine 5′‐diphosphate (UDP)‐glucose as a substrate and polymerizes glucose residues into long β‐1,4‐linked glucan chains in a single‐step reaction. Cellulose synthases are encoded by genes belonging to a superfamily, and each plant synthesizes a number of different cellulose synthases. Genetic analysis suggests that each cellulose‐synthesizing complex contains at least three nonredundant cellulose synthases and mutation in any one of these cellulose synthases results in cellulose deficiency. More interestingly, different cellulose synthases perform cellulose synthesis in the primary cell wall and the secondary cell wall. Apart from the cellulose synthases, a number of other proteins have been suggested to play a role in cellulose synthesis, but so far their functions are not clearly understood. Genetic manipulation of cellulose synthesis in plants will therefore require not only a complete understanding of the different cellulose synthases but also other proteins that regulate the temporal and spatial synthesis and assembly of this very important polysaccharide.},

Together, these actin–myosin interactions enable large-scale movement and force generation, two primary attributes of muscle. Research on isolated fibres has provided considerable insight into the collective properties of muscle, but how actin–myosin interactions are coordinated in an ensemble remains poorly understood. Here, we show that artificial myosin filaments, engineered using a DNA nanotube scaffold, provide precise control over motor number, type and spacing. Using both dimeric myosin V- and myosin VI-labelled nanotubes, we find that neither myosin density nor spacing has a significant effect on the gliding speed of actin filaments. This observation supports a simple model of myosin ensembles as energy reservoirs that buffer individual stochastic events to bring about smooth, continuous motion. Furthermore, gliding speed increases with cross-bridge compliance, but is limited by Brownian effects. As a first step to reconstituting muscle motility, we demonstrate human β-cardiac myosin-driven gliding of actin filaments on DNA nanotubes.},

The technological advances that have enabled direct observation and manipulation of single molecules, including recent experiments that have explored myosin’s force-dependent properties, provide detailed insight into the kinetics of myosin’s mechanochemical interaction with actin. However, it has been difficult to reconcile these single-molecule observations with the behavior of myosin in an ensemble. Here, using a combination of simulations and theory, we show that the kinetic mechanism derived from single-molecule experiments describes ensemble behavior; but the connection between single molecule and ensemble is complex. In particular, even in the absence of external force, internal forces generated between myosin molecules in a large ensemble accelerate ADP release and increase how far actin moves during a single myosin attachment. These myosin-induced changes in strong binding lifetime and attachment distance cause measurable properties, such as actin speed in the motility assay, to vary depending on the number of myosin molecules interacting with an actin filament. This ensemble-size effect challenges the simple detachment limited model of motility, because even when motility speed is limited by ADP release, increasing attachment rate can increase motility speed.},

	abstract = {Abiotic stress, such as salinity, cause global yield loss of all major crop plants. Factors and mechanisms that can aid in plant breeding for salt stress tolerance are therefore of great importance for food and feed production. Here, we identified a MYB-like transcription factor, Salt-Related MYB1 (SRM1), that negatively affects Arabidopsis seed germination under saline conditions by regulating the levels of the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Accordingly, several ABA biosynthesis and signaling genes act directly downstream of SRM1, including STO1/NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3 (NCED3), RESPONSIVE TO DESICCATION 26 (RD26) and ANAC019. Furthermore, SRM1 impacts on vegetative growth and leaf shape. We show that SRM1 is an important transcriptional regulator that directly targets ABA biosynthesis and signaling-related genes and therefore may be regarded as an important regulator of ABA mediated salt stress tolerance.},

In these systems, levels of organization often emerge, as evidenced by cases where cells form tissues, tissues form organs, and organs interact to form complete organisms. We hypothesized that that laws exist that describe system functioning at one level, independently of the configuration at other levels. The hypothesis was tested using simulations of motor protein systems, and demonstrated that patterns in their behavior emerge at a systems level. Results demonstrated a law concerning energy utilization predicts the lifetime of these systems before dissociation, regardless of the components present in the system. These findings reveal organizational laws that simplify complex systems analysis and can facilitate engineering design approaches for bio-based technologies.},

Summary
The plant cell wall is central to plant development. Cellulose is a major component of plant cell walls, and is the world's most abundant biopolymer. Cellulose contains apparently simple linear chains of glucose residues, but these chains aggregate to form immensely strong microfibrils. It is the physical properties of these microfibrils that, when laid down in an organized manner, are responsible for both oriented cell elongation during plant growth and the strength required to maintain an upright growth habit. Despite the importance of cellulose, only recently have we started to unravel details of its synthesis. Mutational analysis has allowed us to identify some of the proteins involved in its synthesis at the plasma membrane, and to define a set of cellulose synthase enzymes essential for cellulose synthesis. These proteins are organized into a very large plasma membrane-localized protein complex. The way in which this protein complex is regulated and directed is central in depositing cellulose microfibrils in the wall in the correct orientation, which is essential for directional cell growth. Recent developments have given us clues as to how cellulose synthesis and deposition is regulated, an understanding of which is essential if we are to manipulate cell wall composition.},

	abstract = {When a muscle contracts and shortens against a load, it performs work. The performance of work is fuelled by the expenditure of metabolic energy, more properly quantified as enthalpy (i.e., heat plus work). The ratio of work performed to enthalpy produced provides one measure of efficiency. However, if the primary interest is in the efficiency of the actomyosin cross-bridges, then the metabolic overheads associated with basal metabolism and excitation–contraction coupling, together with those of subsequent metabolic recovery process, must be subtracted from the total heat and work observed. By comparing the cross-bridge work component of the remainder to the Gibbs free energy of hydrolysis of ATP, a measure of thermodynamic efficiency is achieved. We describe and quantify this partitioning process, providing estimates of the efficiencies of selected steps, while discussing the errors that can arise in the process of quantification. The dependence of efficiency on animal species, fibre-type, temperature, and contractile velocity is considered. The effect of contractile velocity on energetics is further examined using a two-state, Huxley-style, mathematical model of cross-bridge cycling that incorporates filament compliance. Simulations suggest only a modest effect of filament compliance on peak efficiency, but progressively larger gains (vis-à-vis the rigid filament case) as contractile velocity approaches Vmax. This effect is attributed primarily to a reduction in the component of energy loss arising from detachment of cross-bridge heads at non-zero strain.},

	abstract = {Summary
Abiotic stress, such as salinity, drought, and cold, causes detrimental yield losses for all major plant crop species. Understanding mechanisms that improve plants’ ability to produce biomass, which largely is constituted by the plant cell wall, is therefore of upmost importance for agricultural activities. Cellulose is a principal component of the cell wall and is synthesized by microtubule-guided cellulose synthase enzymes at the plasma membrane. Here, we identified two components of the cellulose synthase complex, which we call companion of cellulose synthase (CC) proteins. The cytoplasmic tails of these membrane proteins bind to microtubules and promote microtubule dynamics. This activity supports microtubule organization, cellulose synthase localization at the plasma membrane, and renders seedlings less sensitive to stress. Our findings offer a mechanistic model for how two molecular components, the CC proteins, sustain microtubule organization and cellulose synthase localization and thus aid plant biomass production during salt stress.

Despite the difficulties, researchers must frequently perform these tasks so that available knowledge can be continually integrated into the common framework required to realize the Human Physiome. Software and infrastructures that support the communities that generate these, together with their underlying standards to format, describe and interlink the corresponding data and computer models, are pivotal to the Human Physiome being realized. They provide the foundations for integrating, exchanging and re-using data and models efficiently, and correctly, while also supporting the dissemination of growing knowledge in these forms.

The most challenging diseases, those with the largest socioeconomic impact (cardiovascular conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, cancer, metabolic, immunity and neurodegenerative conditions) are all characterised by a complex genotype/phenotype interaction, and in general by a “systemic” nature that the traditional reductionist approach struggle to cope with. In May 2005 a small group of researchers with different backgrounds met in Barcelona to discuss how the vision of computational physiology promoted by the Physiome Project could be translated into the clinical practice. In that meeting the term Virtual Physiological Human was formally proposed. We know a lot about these diseases, but our knowledge is fragmentary as it is associated with molecular and cellular processes on the one hand, and with tissue and organ phenotype changes (related to clinical symptoms of disease conditions) on the other. The problem could be solved if we could capture all these fragments of knowledge into predictive models and then compose them into hypermodels that help us to tame the complexity that such systemic behaviour involves. In 2005 this was simply not possible - the necessary methods and technologies were not available. Now, ten years later, it seems the right time to reflect on the original vision, the results achieved so far, and what remains to be done.

	abstract = {The regulation of cardiac cellular bioenergetics is critical for maintaining normal cell function, yet the nature of this regulation is not fully understood. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain how mitochondrial ATP production is regulated to match changing cellular energy demand while metabolite concentrations are maintained. We have developed an integrated mathematical model of cardiac cellular bioenergetics, electrophysiology, and mechanics to test whether stimulation of the dehydrogenase flux by Ca2+ or Pi, or stimulation of complex III by Pi can increase the rate of mitochondrial ATP production above that determined by substrate availability (ADP and Pi). Using the model, we show that, under physiological conditions the rate of mitochondrial ATP production can match varying demand through substrate availability alone; that ATP production rate is not limited by the supply of reducing equivalents in the form of NADH, as a result of Ca2+ or Pi activation of the dehydrogenases; and that ATP production rate is sensitive to feedback activation of complex III by Pi. We then investigate the mechanistic implications on cytosolic ion homeostasis and force production by simulating the concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+, Na+ and K+, and activity of the key ATPases, SERCA pump, Na+/K+ pump and actin‐myosin ATPase, in response to increasing cellular energy demand. We find that feedback regulation of mitochondrial complex III by Pi improves the coupling between energy demand and mitochondrial ATP production and stabilizes cytosolic ADP and Pi concentrations. This subsequently leads to stabilized cytosolic ionic concentrations and consequentially reduced energetic cost from cellular ATPases.},

	abstract = {Objectives:  The luminal surface of the gut is lined with a monolayer of epithelial cells that acts as a nutrient absorptive engine and protective barrier. To maintain its integrity and functionality, the epithelium is renewed every few days. Theoretical models are powerful tools that can be used to test hypotheses concerning the regulation of this renewal process, to investigate how its dysfunction can lead to loss of homeostasis and neoplasia, and to identify potential therapeutic interventions. Here we propose a new multiscale model for crypt dynamics that links phenomena occurring at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels of organisation. Methods:  At the subcellular level, deterministic models characterise molecular networks, such as cell-cycle control and Wnt signalling. The output of these models determines the behaviour of each epithelial cell in response to intra-, inter- and extracellular cues. The modular nature of the model enables us to easily modify individual assumptions and analyse their effects on the system as a whole. Results:  We perform virtual microdissection and labelling-index experiments, evaluate the impact of various model extensions, obtain new insight into clonal expansion in the crypt, and compare our predictions with recent mitochondrial DNA mutation data. Conclusions:  We demonstrate that relaxing the assumption that stem-cell positions are fixed enables clonal expansion and niche succession to occur. We also predict that the presence of extracellular factors near the base of the crypt alone suffices to explain the observed spatial variation in nuclear beta-catenin levels along the crypt axis.},

It includes receptor activation and mitogenic signaling, initiation of cell cycle, and passage of checkpoints and apoptosis. Time-course experiments measuring mRNA abundance and protein activity are conducted on Caco-2 and HCT 116 colon cell lines. These data were used to constrain unknown regulatory interactions and kinetic parameters via sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization methods contained in the DigitalCell™ computer simulation platform. FACS, RNA knockdown, cell growth, and apoptosis data are also used to constrain the model and to identify unknown pathways, and cross talk between known pathways will also be discussed. Using the cell simulation, GNS tested the efficacy of various drug targets and performed validation experiments to test computer simulation predictions. The simulation is a powerful tool that can in principle incorporate patient-specific data on the DNA, RNA, and protein levels for assessing efficacy of therapeutics in specific patient populations and can greatly impact success of a given therapeutic strategy.},

	abstract = {It is now well established that characteristic properties of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in cardiac myocytes, such as high gain and graded Ca2+ release, arise from the interactions that occur between L-type Ca2+ channels (LCCs) and nearby ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels (RyRs) in localized microdomains. Descriptions of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) that account for these local mechanisms are lacking from many previous models of the cardiac action potential, and those that do include local control of CICR are able to reconstruct properties of EC coupling, but require computationally demanding stochastic simulations of ∼105 individual ion channels. In this study, we generalize a recently developed analytical approach for deriving simplified mechanistic models of CICR to formulate an integrative model of the canine cardiac myocyte which is computationally efficient. The resulting model faithfully reproduces experimentally measured properties of EC coupling and whole cell phenomena. The model is used to study the role of local redundancy in L-type Ca2+ channel gating and the role of dyad configuration on EC coupling. Simulations suggest that the characteristic steep rise in EC coupling gain observed at hyperpolarized potentials is a result of increased functional coupling between LCCs and RyRs. We also demonstrate mechanisms by which alterations in the early repolarization phase of the action potential, resulting from reduction of the transient outward potassium current, alters properties of EC coupling.},

Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

	abstract = {Abstract Metabolism is usually treated as a set of chemical reactions catalysed by separate enzymes. However, various complications, such as transport of molecules across membranes, physical association of different enzymes, giving the possibility of metabolite channelling, need to be taken into account. More generally, a proper understanding of the nature of life will require metabolism to be treated as a complete system, and not just as a collection of components. Certain properties of metabolic systems, such as feedback inhibition of the first committed step of a pathway, make sense only if one takes a broader view of a pathway than is usual in textbooks, so that one can appreciate ideas such as regulation of biosynthesis according to demand. More generally still, consideration of metabolism as a whole puts the emphasis on certain systemic aspects that are crucial but which can pass unnoticed if attention is always focussed on details. For example, a living organism, unlike any machine known or conceivable at present, makes and maintains itself and all of its components. Any serious investigation of how this can be possible implies an infinite regress in which each set of enzymes needed for the metabolic activity of the organism implies the existence of another set of enzymes to maintain them, which, in turn, implies another set, and so on indefinitely. Avoiding this implication of infinite regress represents a major challenge for future investigation.},

	abstract = {Full genome sequences enable the construction of genome-scale in silico models of complex cellular functions. Genome-scale constraints-based models of Escherichia coli metabolism have been constructed and used to successfully interpret and predict cellular behavior under a range of conditions. These previous models do not account for regulation of gene transcription and thus cannot accurately predict some organism functions. Here we present an in silico model of the central E. coli metabolism that accounts for regulation of gene expression. This model accounts for 149 genes, the products of which include 16 regulatory proteins and 73 enzymes. These enzymes catalyze 113 reactions, 45 of which are controlled by transcriptional regulation. The combined metabolic/regulatory model can predict the ability of mutant E. coli strains to grow on defined media as well as time courses of cell growth, substrate uptake, metabolic by-product secretion, and qualitative gene expression under various conditions, as indicated by comparison with experimental data under a variety of environmental conditions. The in silico model may also be used to interpret dynamic behaviors observed in cell cultures. This combined metabolic/regulatory model is thus an important step toward the goal of synthesizing genome-scale models that accurately represent E. coli behavior.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The effort to build a whole-cell model requires the development of new modeling approaches, and in particular, the integration of models for different types of processes, each of which may be best described using different representation. Flux-balance analysis (FBA) has been useful for large-scale analysis of metabolic networks, and methods have been developed to incorporate transcriptional regulation (regulatory FBA, or rFBA). Of current interest is the integration of these approaches with detailed models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
Results: We developed an approach to modeling the dynamic behavior of metabolic, regulatory and signaling networks by combining FBA with regulatory Boolean logic, and ordinary differential equations. We use this approach (called integrated FBA, or iFBA) to create an integrated model of Escherichia coli which combines a flux-balance-based, central carbon metabolic and transcriptional regulatory model with an ODE-based, detailed model of carbohydrate uptake control. We compare the predicted Escherichia coli wild-type and single gene perturbation phenotypes for diauxic growth on glucose/lactose and glucose/glucose-6-phosphate with that of the individual models. We find that iFBA encapsulates the dynamics of three internal metabolites and three transporters inadequately predicted by rFBA. Furthermore, we find that iFBA predicts different and more accurate phenotypes than the ODE model for 85 of 334 single gene perturbation simulations, as well for the wild-type simulations. We conclude that iFBA is a significant improvement over the individual rFBA and ODE modeling paradigms.

CellML has evolved to meet these needs of the modelling community. CellML is a free, open-source, eXtensible markup language based standard for defining mathematical models of cellular function.

	abstract = {Mathematical models are increasingly used to understand how phenotypes emerge from systems of molecular interactions. However, their current construction as monolithic sets of equations presents a fundamental barrier to progress. Overcoming this requires modularity, enabling sub-systems to be specified independently and combined incrementally, and abstraction, enabling generic properties of biological processes to be specified independently of specific instances. These, in turn, require models to be represented as programs rather than as datatypes. Programmable modularity and abstraction enables libraries of modules to be created, which can be instantiated and reused repeatedly in different contexts with different components. We have developed a computational infrastructure that accomplishes this. We show here why such capabilities are needed, what is required to implement them and what can be accomplished with them that could not be done previously.},

Classical concepts in equilibrium thermodynamics–enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of biochemical reaction systems–are generalized to nonequilibrium settings. Chemical motive force, heat dissipation rate, and entropy production (creation) rate, key concepts in nonequilibrium systems, are introduced. Dynamic equations for the thermodynamic quantities are presented in terms of the key observables of a biochemical network: stoichiometric matrix Q, reaction fluxes J, and chemical potentials of species μ without evoking empirical rate laws. Energy conservation and the Second Law are established for steady-state and dynamic biochemical networks.

	abstract = {The bond graph approach to modelling biochemical networks is extended to allow hierarchical construction of complex models from simpler components. This is made possible by representing the simpler components as thermodynamically open systems exchanging mass and energy via ports. A key feature of this approach is that the resultant models are robustly thermodynamically compliant: the thermodynamic compliance is not dependent on precise numerical values of parameters. Moreover, the models are reusable owing to the well-defined interface provided by the energy ports. To extract bond graph model parameters from parameters found in the literature, general and compact formulae are developed to relate free-energy constants and equilibrium constants. The existence and uniqueness of solutions is considered in terms of fundamental properties of stoichiometric matrices. The approach is illustrated by building a hierarchical bond graph model of glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle.},

	abstract = {Acidosis in cardiac myocytes is a major factor in the reduced inotropy that occurs in the ischemic heart. During acidosis, diastolic calcium concentration and the amplitude of the calcium transient increase, while the strength of contraction decreases. This has been attributed to the inhibition by protons of calcium uptake and release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, to a rise of intracellular sodium caused by activation of sodium-hydrogen exchange, decreased calcium binding affinity to Troponin-C, and direct effects on the contractile machinery. The relative contributions and concerted action of these effects are, however, difficult to establish experimentally. We have developed a mathematical model to examine altered calcium-handling mechanisms during acidosis. Each of the alterations was incorporated into a dynamical model of pH regulation and excitation-contraction coupling to predict the time courses of key ionic species during acidosis, in particular intracellular pH, sodium and the calcium transient, and contraction. This modeling study suggests that the most significant effects are elevated sodium, inhibition of sodium-calcium exchange, and the direct interaction of protons with the contractile machinery; and shows how the experimental data on these contributions can be reconciled to understand the overall effects of acidosis in the beating heart.},

	abstract = {Control theory has been instrumental for the analysis and design of a number of engineering systems, including aerospace and transportation systems, robotics and intelligent machines, manufacturing chains, electrical, power, and information networks. In the past several years, the ability of de novo creating biomolecular networks and of measuring key physical quantities has come to a point in which quantitative analysis and design of biological systems is possible. While a modular approach to analyze and design complex systems has proven critical in most control theory applications, it is still subject of debate whether a modular approach is viable in biomolecular networks. In fact, biomolecular networks display context-dependent behavior, that is, the input/output dynamical properties of a module change once this is part of a network. One cause of context dependence, similar to what found in many engineering systems, is retroactivity, that is, the effect of loads applied on a module by downstream systems. In this paper, we focus on retroactivity and review techniques, based on nonlinear control and dynamical systems theory, that we have developed to quantify the extent of modularity of biomolecular systems and to establish modular analysis and design techniques.},

The Hodgkin-Huxley model established a framework in which to describe the structural and functional properties of ion channels, including the mechanisms of ion permeation, selectivity, and gating. At a cellular level, the model is used to understand the conditions that control both the rate and timing of action potentials, essential for neural encoding of information. Finally, the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is central to computational neuroscience to understand both neuronal integration and circuit level information processing, and how these mechanisms might have evolved to minimize energy cost.},

We investigate effects of elevated intracellular sodium on the cardiac action potential (AP) and on intracellular calcium using the Luo–Rudy model of a mammalian ventricular myocyte. The results are: 1) During rapid pacing, AP duration (APD) shortens in two phases, a rapid phase without Na+ accumulation and a slower phase that depends on [Na+]i. 2) The rapid APD shortening is due to incomplete deactivation (accumulation) of IKs. 3) The slow phase is due to increased repolarizing currents INaK and reverse-mode INaCa, secondary to elevated [Na+]i. 4) Na+-overload slows the rate of AP depolarization, allowing time for greater ICa(L) activation; it also enhances reverse-mode INaCa. The resulting increased Ca2+ influx triggers a greater [Ca2+]i transient. 5) Reverse-mode INaCa alone can trigger Ca2+ release in a voltage and [Na+]i-dependent manner. 6) During INaK block, Na+ and Ca2+ accumulate and APD shortens due to enhanced reverse-mode INaCa; contribution of IK(Na) to APD shortening is negligible. By slowing AP depolarization (hence velocity) and shortening APD, Na+-overload acts to enhance inducibility of reentrant arrhythmias. Shortened APD with elevated [Ca2+]i (secondary to Na+-overload) also predisposes the myocardium to arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations.},

For each reaction, its steady-state flux J can be decomposed into forward and backward one-way fluxes J = J+ – J, with chemical potential difference Δµ = RT ln(J–/J+). The product –JΔµ gives the isothermal heat dissipation rate, which is necessarily non-negative according to the second law of thermodynamics. The stoichiometric network theory (SNT) embodies all of the relevant fundamental physics. Knowing J and Δµ of a biochemical reaction, a conductance can be computed which directly reflects the level of gene expression for the particular enzyme. For sufficiently small flux a linear relationship between J and Δµ can be established as the linear flux–force relation in irreversible thermodynamics, analogous to Ohm's law in electrical circuits.},

	abstract = {Ischemia-induced hyperkalemia (accumulation of extracellular K+) predisposes the heart to the development of lethal reentrant ventricular arrhythmias. This phenomenon exhibits a triphasic time course and is thought to be mediated by a combination of three mechanisms: 1) increased cellular K+ efflux, 2) decreased cellular K+ influx, and 3) shrinkage of the extracellular space. These ischemia-induced electrophysiological changes are driven by an impaired cellular metabolism. However, the relative contributions of these mechanisms, as well as the origin of the triphasic profile, have proven to be difficult to determine experimentally. In this study, the changes in metabolite concentrations that arise during 15 min of zero-flow global ischemia were incorporated into a dynamic model of cellular electrophysiology, which was extended to include a metabolically sensitive description of the Na+-K+ pump and ATP-sensitive K+ channel, in addition to cell volume regulation. The coupling of altered K+ fluxes and cell volume regulation enables an integrative simulation of ischemic hyperkalemia. These simulations were able to quantitatively reproduce experimental measurements of the accumulation of extracellular K+ during 15 min of simulated ischemia, both with respect to the degree of K+ loss as well as the triphasic time course. Analysis of the model indicates that the inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump is the dominant factor underlying this hyperkalemic behavior, accounting for ∼85\% of the observed extracellular K+ accumulation. It was found that the balance between activation and inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump, affected by the changing metabolite and ion concentrations (in particular, [ADP]), give rise to the triphasic profile associated with ischemic hyperkalemia.},

As even more complex models are developed over the coming few years, it will be necessary to develop new methods to model them (in particular in coupling across the interface between stochastic and deterministic processes) and new techniques will be required to compute their solutions efficiently on massively parallel computers.

	abstract = {A mathematical model of the cardiac ventricular action potential is presented. In our previous work, the membrane Na+ current and K+ currents were formulated. The present article focuses on processes that regulate intracellular Ca2+ and depend on its concentration. The model presented here for the mammalian ventricular action potential is based mostly on the guinea pig ventricular cell. However, it provides the framework for modeling other types of ventricular cells with appropriate modifications made to account for species differences. The following processes are formulated: Ca2+ current through the L-type channel (ICa), the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, Ca2+ release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), buffering of Ca2+ in the SR and in the myoplasm, a Ca2+ pump in the sarcolemma, the Na(+)-K+ pump, and a nonspecific Ca(2+)-activated membrane current. Activation of ICa is an order of magnitude faster than in previous models. Inactivation of ICa depends on both the membrane voltage and [Ca2+]i. SR is divided into two subcompartments, a network SR (NSR) and a junctional SR (JSR). Functionally, Ca2+ enters the NSR and translocates to the JSR following a monoexponential function. Release of Ca2+ occurs at JSR and can be triggered by two different mechanisms, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and spontaneous release. The model provides the basis for the study of arrhythmogenic activity of the single myocyte including afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. It can simulate cellular responses under different degrees of Ca2+ overload. Such simulations are presented in our accompanying article in this issue of Circulation Research.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models were developed to reconstruct the action potentials (AP) recorded in epicardial and endocardial myocytes isolated from the adult rat left ventricle. The main goal was to obtain additional insight into the ionic mechanisms responsible for the transmural AP heterogeneity. The simulation results support the hypothesis that the smaller density and the slower reactivation kinetics of the Ca2+-independent transient outward K+ current (It) in the endocardial myocytes can account for the longer action potential duration (APD), and more prominent rate dependence in that cell type. The larger density of the Na+ current (INa) in the endocardial myocytes results in a faster upstroke (dV/dtmax). This, in addition to the smaller magnitude of It, is responsible for the larger peak overshoot of the simulated endocardial AP. The prolonged APD in the endocardial cell also leads to an enhanced amplitude of the sustained K+ current (Iss), and a larger influx of Ca2+ ions via the L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL). The latter results in an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) load, which is mainly responsible for the higher peak systolic value of the Ca2+ transient [Ca2+]i, and the resultant increase in the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (INaCa) activity, associated with the simulated endocardial AP. In combination, these calculations provide novel, quantitative insights into the repolarization process and its naturally occurring transmural variations in the rat left ventricle.},

Existing local control models of Ca2+ release in which interactions between L-Type Ca2+ channels (LCCs) and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels (RyRs) are simulated stochastically are able to reconstruct these properties, but only at high computational cost. Here we present a general analytical approach for deriving simplified models of local control of CICR, consisting of low-dimensional systems of coupled ordinary differential equations, from these more complex local control models in which LCC-RyR interactions are simulated stochastically. The resulting model, referred to as the coupled LCC-RyR gating model, successfully reproduces a range of experimental data, including L-Type Ca2+ current in response to voltage-clamp stimuli, inactivation of LCC current with and without Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, voltage-dependence of excitation-contraction coupling gain, graded release, and the force-frequency relationship.

	abstract = {The determinants of relaxation in cardiac muscle are poorly understood, yet compromised relaxation accompanies various pathologies and impaired pump function. In this study, we develop a model of active contraction to elucidate the relative importance of the [Ca2+]i transient magnitude, the unbinding of Ca2+ from troponin C (TnC), and the length-dependence of tension and Ca2+ sensitivity on relaxation. Using the framework proposed by one of our researchers, we extensively reviewed experimental literature, to quantitatively characterize the binding of Ca2+ to TnC, the kinetics of tropomyosin, the availability of binding sites, and the kinetics of crossbridge binding after perturbations in sarcomere length. Model parameters were determined from multiple experimental results and modalities (skinned and intact preparations) and model results were validated against data from length step, caged Ca2+, isometric twitches, and the half-time to relaxation with increasing sarcomere length experiments. A factorial analysis found that the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding of Ca2+ from TnC were the primary determinants of relaxation, with a fivefold greater effect than that of length-dependent maximum tension and twice the effect of tension-dependent binding of Ca2+ to TnC and length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity. The affects of the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding rate of Ca2+ from TnC were tightly coupled with the effect of increasing either factor, depending on the reference [Ca2+]i transient and unbinding rate.},

	abstract = {A computational model for the mitochondrial respiratory chain that appropriately balances mass, charge, and free energy transduction is introduced and analyzed based on a previously published set of data measured on isolated cardiac mitochondria. The basic components included in the model are the reactions at complexes I, III, and IV of the electron transport system, ATP synthesis at F 1 F 0  ATPase, substrate transporters including adenine nucleotide translocase and the phosphate–hydrogen co-transporter, and cation fluxes across the inner membrane including fluxes through the K + /H +  antiporter and passive H +  and K +  permeation. Estimation of 16 adjustable parameter values is based on fitting model simulations to nine independent data curves. The identified model is further validated by comparison to additional datasets measured from mitochondria isolated from rat heart and liver and observed at low oxygen concentration. To obtain reasonable fits to the available data, it is necessary to incorporate inorganic-phosphate-dependent activation of the dehydrogenase activity and the electron transport system. Specifically, it is shown that a model incorporating phosphate-dependent activation of complex III is able to reasonably reproduce the observed data. The resulting validated and verified model provides a foundation for building larger and more complex systems models and investigating complex physiological and pathophysiological interactions in cardiac energetics.},

	abstract = {A method for obtaining approximate bond graph models for linear time invariant (LTI) Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems with singular perturbations is presented. The basic idea of using time-scale analysis in obtaining low-order models is to decouple the slow and fast models. This is achieved by using two-stage linear transformations. Hence, a procedure to construct decoupled bond graph models based on R-fields representing each dynamic of the singularly perturbed system is proposed.When the linear transformations are applied to the system with singular perturbations, non-linear and linear equations have to be solved for separating the subsystems. In many cases, the exact solutions of these equations are complicated, but approximate solutions can be determined and approximate models can be obtained.Thus, zeroth- and first-order solutions in a bond graph approach are proposed. The key to finding the approximate solutions is to obtain the relations of the original bond graph with a predefined integral causality of the system and another bond graph called the Singularly Perturbed Bond Graph whose storage elements of the fast dynamics have derivative causality and for the slow dynamics they maintain an integral causality assignment.Finally, the proposed method is applied to an illustrative example where the simulation results show the exact solutions and zeroth- and first-order approximations.},

	abstract = {Bonds graphs have been around for a quarter of a century. While originally intended for modeling mechanical systems, they have meanwhile found widespread applications in many areas of physical system modeling. Bond graphs are a very appealing tool for modeling physical systems, because they represent the flow of power through a system. Since energy and mass are the only tradable goods in our physical universe, a bond graph model is more likely to reflect physical reality than a model derived by use of any other modeling methodology. However, bond graphs, like all graphical techniques, become unwieldy when applied to complex sys tems. Also, bond graphs were traditionally used to model predominantly linear systems. This paper introduces new concepts for modeling complex physical systems through hierarchical bond graphs which can include arbitrary non-linearities. It introduces a software tool that can be used to implement these hierarchical non-linear band graphs. Finally, a new application area for bond graphs will be discussed. It will be demonstrated how these hierarchical non-linear bond graphs can be used to model chemical reaction kinetics and chemical thermodynamics together in very general terms also farther away from equilibrium than traditional approaches would permit.},

	abstract = {Covalent modification cycles are ubiquitous. Theoretical studies have suggested that they serve to increase sensitivity. However, this suggestion has not been corroborated experimentally in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that the assumptions of the theoretical studies, i.e., irreversibility and absence of product inhibition, were not trivial: when the conversion reactions are close to equilibrium or saturated by their product, “zero-order” ultrasensitivity disappears. For high sensitivities to arise, not only substrate saturation (zero-order) but also high equilibrium constants and low product saturation are required. Many covalent modification cycles are catalyzed by one bifunctional ‘ambiguous’ enzyme rather than by two independent proteins. This makes high substrate concentration and low product concentration for both reactions of the cycle inconsistent; such modification cycles cannot have high responses. Defining signal strength as ratios of modified (e.g., phosphorylated) over unmodified protein, signal-to-signal response sensitivity equals 1: signal strength should remain constant along a cascade of ambiguous modification cycles. We also show that the total concentration of a signalling effector protein cannot affect the signal emanating from a modification cycle catalyzed by an ambiguous enzyme if the ratio of the two forms of the effector protein is not altered. This finding may explain the experimental result that the pivotal signal transduction protein PII plus its paralogue GlnK do not control steady-state N-signal transduction in Escherichia coli. It also rationalizes the absence of strong phenotypes for many signal-transduction proteins. Emphasis on extent of modification of these proteins is perhaps more urgent than transcriptome analysis.},

While the goal of mathematical modeling in cognitive psychology is to select one model from a set of competing models that best captures the underlying mental process, choosing the model that best fits a particular set of data will not achieve this goal. This is because a highly complex model can provide a good fit without necessarily bearing any interpretable relationship with the underlying process. It is shown that model selection based solely on the fit to observed data will result in the choice of an unnecessarily complex model that overfits the data, and thus generalizes poorly. The effect of over-fitting must be properly offset by model selection methods. An application example of selection methods using artificial data is also presented.},

	abstract = {Cytosolic Ca2+ signals are often organized in complex temporal and spatial patterns, even under conditions of sustained stimulation. In this review we discuss the mechanisms and physiological significance of this behavior in nonexcitable cells, in which the primary mechanism of Ca2+ mobilization is through (1,4,5)IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Oscillations of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) are a common form of temporal organization; in the spatial domain, these [Ca2+]i oscillations may take the form of [Ca2+]i waves that propagate throughout the cell or they may be restricted to specific subcellular regions. These patterns of Ca2+ signaling result from the limited range of cytoplasmic Ca2+ diffusion and the feedback regulation of the pathways responsible for Ca2+ mobilization. In addition, the spatial organization of [Ca2+]i changes appears to depend on the strategic distribution of Ca2+ stores within the cell. One type of [Ca2+]i oscillation is baseline spiking, in which discrete [Ca2+]i spikes occur with a frequency, but not amplitude, that is determined by agonist dose. Most current evidence favors a model in which baseline [Ca2+]i spiking results from the complex interplay between [Ca2+]i and (1,4,5)IP3 in regulating the gating of (1,4,5)IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ channels. Sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations represent a mechanistically distinct type of temporal organization, in which agonist dose regulates the amplitude but has no effect on oscillation frequency. Sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations can be explained by a negative feedback effect of protein kinase C on the generation of (1,4,5)IP3 at the level of phospholipase C or its activating G-protein. The physiological significance of [Ca2+]i oscillations and waves is becoming more established with the observation of this behavior in intact tissues and by the recognition of Ca2+-dependent processes that are adapted to respond to frequency-modulated oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals. In some cells, these [Ca2+]i signals are targeted to control processes in limited cytoplasmic domains, and in other systems [Ca2+]i waves can be propagated through gap junctions to coordinate the function of multicellular systems.},

The mechanics of the force-length work-loop contraction mimic those of the pressure-volume work-loops experienced by the heart. Within the measurement chamber of a flow-through microcalorimeter, a trabecula is electrically stimulated to respond, under software control, in one of three modes: fixed-end, isometric, or isotonic. In each mode, software controls the position of a linear motor, with feedback from muscle force, to adjust muscle length in the desired temporal sequence. In the case of a work-loop contraction, the software achieves seamless transitions between phases of length control (isometric contraction, isometric relaxation, and restoration of resting muscle length) and force control (isotonic shortening). The area enclosed by the resulting force-length loop represents the work done by the trabecula. The change of enthalpy expended by the muscle is given by the sum of the work term and the associated amount of evolved heat. With these simultaneous measurements, we provide the first estimation of suprabasal, net mechanical efficiency (ratio of work to change of enthalpy) of mammalian cardiac trabeculae. The maximum efficiency is at the vicinity of 12\%.},

	abstract = {In arterial smooth muscle, protein kinase Cα (PKCα) coerces discrete clusters of L-type Ca2+ channels to operate in a high open probability mode, resulting in subcellular domains of nearly continual Ca2+ influx called ‘persistent Ca2+ sparklets’. Our previous work suggested that steady-state Ca2+ entry into arterial myocytes, and thus global [Ca2+]i, is regulated by Ca2+ influx through clusters of L-type Ca2+ channels operating in this persistently active mode in addition to openings of solitary channels functioning in a low-activity mode. Here, we provide the first direct evidence supporting this ‘Ca2+ sparklet’ model of Ca2+ influx at a physiological membrane potential and external Ca2+ concentration. In support of this model, we found that persistent Ca2+ sparklets produced local and global elevations in [Ca2+]i. Membrane depolarization increased Ca2+ influx via low-activity and high-activity persistent Ca2+ sparklets. Our data indicate that Ca2+ entering arterial smooth muscle through persistent Ca2+ sparklets accounts for approximately 50\% of the total dihydropyridine-sensitive (i.e. L-type Ca2+ channel) Ca2+ influx at a physiologically relevant membrane potential (−40 mV) and external Ca2+ concentration (2 mm). Consistent with this, inhibition of basal PKCα-dependent persistent Ca2+ sparklets decreased [Ca2+]i by about 50\% in isolated arterial myocytes and intact pressurized arteries. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that in arterial smooth muscle steady-state Ca2+ entry and global [Ca2+]i are regulated by low-activity and PKCα-dependent high-activity persistent Ca2+ sparklets.},

	abstract = {Functional organization of signal transduction into protein phosphorylation cascades, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, greatly enhances the sensitivity of cellular targets to external stimuli. The sensitivity increases multiplicatively with the number of cascade levels, so that a tiny change in a stimulus results in a large change in the response, the phenomenon referred to as ultrasensitivity. In a variety of cell types, the MAPK cascades are imbedded in long feedback loops, positive or negative, depending on whether the terminal kinase stimulates or inhibits the activation of the initial level. Here we demonstrate that a negative feedback loop combined with intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the MAPK cascade can bring about sustained oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation. Based on recent kinetic data on the MAPK cascades, we predict that the period of oscillations can range from minutes to hours. The phosphorylation level can vary between the base level and almost 100\% of the total protein.

	abstract = {A new computational method was developed for modeling the effects of the geometric complexity, nonuniform muscle fiber orientation, and material inhomogeneity of the ventricular wall on cardiac impulse propagation. The method was used to solve a modification to the FitzHugh-Nagumo system of equations. The geometry, local muscle fiber orientation, and material parameters of the domain were defined using linear Lagrange or cubic Hermite finite element interpolation. Spatial variations of time-dependent excitation and recovery variables were approximated using cubic Hermite finite element interpolation, and the governing finite element equations were assembled using the collocation method. To overcome the deficiencies of conventional collocation methods on irregular domains, Galerkin equations for the no-flux boundary conditions were used instead of collocation equations for the boundary degrees-of-freedom. The resulting system was evolved using an adaptive Runge-Kutta method. Converged two-dimensional simulations of normal propagation showed that this method requires less CPU time than a traditional finite difference discretization. The model also reproduced several other physiologic phenomena known to be important in arrhythmogenesis including: Wenckebach periodicity, slowed propagation and unidirectional block due to wavefront curvature, reentry around a fixed obstacle, and spiral wave reentry. In a new result, the authors observed wavespeed variations and block due to nonuniform muscle fiber orientation. The findings suggest that the finite element method is suitable for studying normal and pathological cardiac activation and has significant advantages over existing techniques.},

	abstract = {Summary The central hypothesis of this investigation is that a shortening myocyte generates a time-varying transmural pressure, or intracellular pressure. A mathematical model was formulated for a single myocyte, consisting of a fluid-filled cylindrical shell with axially arranged contractile filaments, to quantitate the fiberfluid interaction. In this model, the intracellular pressure mediates the interaction between myofilament force, cell shortening, and the mechanical properties of the sarcolemma. Shortening of myofibrils, which are embedded in the fluid-filled myocytes, deforms the myocyte, thereby altering its transmural fluid pressure. This increase in transmural pressure counteracts fiber shortening, hence constituting an internal load to shortening. The shortening of the myocyte is accompanied by thickening, due to the incompressible nature of its contents. Consequently, the overall contractile performance of the cell is integrally linked to the generation of intracellular pressure. The model manifests a positive transmural pressure during shortening, but not without shortening. The pressure in the myocyte, therefore, is not a direct function of the force generated, but rather of shortening. Intracellular pressure was measured through a fluid-filled glass micropipette (5 µ ID) employing a servo-nulling pressure transducer in a standard micropuncture technique. Measured intracellular pressure in a contracting isolated skeletal myocyte of the giant barnacle is observed to be dynamically related to shortening, but not to tension without shortening. The relation between the force of contraction, cell shortening, and intracellular pressure was assessed during both isotonic and isometric contractions. The results support the prediction that isometric, or nondeforming, contractions will not develop intracellular pressure and identify a reason for relengthening of the myocytes during relaxation.},

	abstract = {Calcineurin (PP2B) is a calcium/calmodulin-activated, serine-threonine phosphatase that transmits signals to the nucleus through the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) transcription factors. Whereas calcineurin-NFAT signaling has been implicated in regulating the hypertrophic growth of the myocardium, considerable controversy persists as to its role in maintaining versus initiating hypertrophy, its role in pathological versus physiological hypertrophy, and its role in heart failure. To address these issues, NFAT-luciferase reporter transgenic mice were generated and characterized. These mice showed robust and calcineurin-specific activation in the heart that was inhibited with cyclosporin A. In the adult heart, NFAT-luciferase activity was upregulated in a delayed, but sustained manner throughout eight weeks of pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure-overload, or more dramatically following myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. In contrast, physiological hypertrophy as produced in two separate models of exercise training failed to show significant calcineurin-NFAT coupling in the heart at multiple time points, despite measurable increases in heart to body weight ratios. Moreover, stimulation of hypertrophy with growth hormone–insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH-IGF-1) failed to activate calcineurin-NFAT signaling in the heart or in culture, despite hypertrophy, activation of Akt, and activation of p70 S6K. Calcineurin Aβ gene–targeted mice also showed a normal hypertrophic response after GH-IGF-1 infusion. Lastly, exercise- or GH-IGF-1–induced cardiac growth failed to show induction of hypertrophic marker gene expression compared with pressure-overloaded animals. Although a direct cause-and-effect relationship between NFAT-luciferase activity and pathological hypertrophy was not proven here, our results support the hypothesis that separable signaling pathways regulate pathological versus physiological hypertrophic growth of the myocardium, with calcineurin-NFAT potentially serving a regulatory role that is more specialized for maladaptive hypertrophy and heart failure.},

	abstract = {In patients with diabetes, an increased risk of symptomatic heart failure usually develops in the presence of hypertension or ischemic heart disease. However, a predisposition to heart failure might also reflect the effects of underlying abnormalities in diastolic function that can occur in asymptomatic patients with diabetes alone (termed diabetic cardiomyopathy). Evidence of cardiomyopathy has also been demonstrated in animal models of both Type 1 (streptozotocin-induced diabetes) and Type 2 diabetes (Zucker diabetic fatty rats and ob/ob or db/db mice). During insulin resistance or diabetes, the heart rapidly modifies its energy metabolism, resulting in augmented fatty acid and decreased glucose consumption. Accumulating evidence suggests that this alteration of cardiac metabolism plays an important role in the development of cardiomyopathy. Hence, a better understanding of this dysregulation in cardiac substrate utilization during insulin resistance and diabetes could provide information as to potential targets for the treatment of cardiomyopathy. This review is focused on evaluating the acute and chronic regulation and dysregulation of cardiac metabolism in normal and insulin-resistant/diabetic hearts and how these changes could contribute toward the development of cardiomyopathy.},

Computational tools for predicting fluxes in biochemical networks are applied in the fields of integrated and systems biology, bioinformatics, and genomics, and to aid in drug discovery and identification of potential drug targets. Approaches, such as flux balance analysis (FBA), that account for the known stoichiometry of the reaction network while avoiding implementation of detailed reaction kinetics are promising tools for the analysis of large complex networks. Here we introduce energy balance analysis (EBA)—the theory and methodology for enforcing the laws of thermodynamics in such simulations—making the results more physically realistic and revealing greater insight into the regulatory and control mechanisms operating in complex large-scale systems. We show that EBA eliminates thermodynamically infeasible results associated with FBA.},

A perspective of the current state of the art in model integration and sharing along with archiving of experimental data will be presented here in the context of multiscale physiological models.

This approach allows the user to work at the biological rather than computational level of abstraction and helps minimize the amount of manual effort required for model composition. To support this compositional approach, we have developed the SemGen software, and here report on SemGen’s semantics-based merging capabilities using real-world modeling use cases. We successfully reproduced a large, manually-encoded, multi-model merge: the “Pandit-Hinch-Niederer” (PHN) cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction model, previously developed using CellML. We describe our approach for annotating the three component models used in the PHN composition and for merging them at the biological level of abstraction within SemGen. We demonstrate that we were able to reproduce the original PHN model results in a semi-automated, semantics-based fashion and also rapidly generate a second, novel cardiomyocyte model composed using an alternative, independently-developed tension generation component. We discuss the time-saving features of our compositional approach in the context of these merging exercises, the limitations we encountered, and potential solutions for enhancing the approach.},

	abstract = {Systems for describing myocardial cellular metabolism with appropriate thermodynamic constraints on reactions have to be on the basis of estimates of intracellular and mitochondrial concentrations of metabolites as driving forces for reactions. This requires that tissue composition itself must be modeled, but there is marked inconsistency in the literature and no full data set on hearts of any species. To formulate a self-consistent set of information on the densities, contents, or concentrations of chemical components and volumes of tissue spaces, we drew on information mostly on rats. From the data on densities, volumes, volume fractions, and mass fractions observed mainly on left ventricular myocardium, cytoplasm, and mitochondria and from morphometric data on cellular components and the vasculature, we constructed a matrix based on conservation laws for density, volume, and constituent composition. The four constituents were water, protein, fat, and solutes (or ash). To take into account the variances in the observed data sets, we used a constrained nonlinear least squares optimization to minimize the differences between the final results and the data sets. The results provide a detailed estimate of cardiac tissue composition, previously unavailable, for the translation of whole tissue concentrations or concentrations per gram protein into estimated local concentrations that are relevant to reaction processes. An example is that the concentrations of phosphocreatine and ATP in cytosolic water space are twice as high as their mean tissue concentrations. This conservation optimization method is applicable to any tissue or organ.},

This law is often assumed to have been “there” forever, but it has its own history, background, and a definite starting point. The law has had an impact on chemistry, biochemistry, biomathematics, and systems biology that is difficult to overestimate. It is easily recognized that it is the direct basis for computational enzyme kinetics, ecological systems models, and models for the spread of diseases. The article reviews the explicit and implicit role of the law of mass action in systems biology and reveals how the original, more general formulation of the law emerged one hundred years later ab initio as a very general, canonical representation of biological processes.},

	abstract = {The sarcoplasmic reticulum of the frog's sartorius muscle was examined by electron microscopy following sequential fixation in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide and embedding in Epon. The earlier results of Porter and Palade on Ambystoma muscle were confirmed in the sartorius. In addition, the transverse tubules were observed to be continuous across the width of the fiber, a set of flat intermediate cisternae was seen to connect the terminal cisternae to the longitudinal tubules in the A band, and the continuous reticulum collar at the center of the A band was found to be perforated by circular and elongated pores (the fenestrated collar). The transverse tubules have a volume about 0.3 per cent of the fiber volume, and a surface area about 7 times the outer cylindrical surface area for a fiber 100 µ in diameter. The terminal cisternae, the intermediate cisternae, and the longitudinal tubules together with the fenestrated collar each have a volume of 4 to 5 per cent of the fiber volume and a surface area 40 to 50 times the outer surface area of a fiber 100 µ in diameter. Some evidence for continuity of the transverse tubules with the fiber surface is presented, but this is thought to be not so convincing as evidence presented by others. The results are discussed in terms of a possible mechanism for a role of the transverse tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum in excitation-contraction coupling, as suggested by their morphology and a variety of physiological studies. In this scheme, the transverse tubules are thought to be electrically coupled to the terminal cisternae, so that depolarization of the fiber surface spreads inward along the transverse tubules and to the terminal cisternae, initiating the release of a contraction-activating substance.},

	abstract = {It has been postulated that cardiac cell models accounting for changes in intracellular ion concentrations violate a conservation principle, and, as a result, computed parameters (e.g., ion concentrations and transmembrane potential, Vm) drift in time, never attaining steady state. To address this issue, models have been proposed that invoke the charge conservation principle to calculate Vm from ion concentrations (“algebraic” method), rather than from transmembrane current (“differential” method). The aims of this study are to compare model behavior during prolonged periods of pacing using the algebraic and differential methods, and to address the issue of model drift. We pace the Luo–Rudy dynamic model of a cardiac ventricular cell and compare the time-dependent behavior of computed parameters using the algebraic and differential methods. When ions carried by the stimulus current are taken into account, the algebraic and differential methods yield identical results and neither shows drift in computed parameters. The present study establishes the proper pacing protocol for simulation studies of cellular behavior during long periods of rapid pacing. Such studies are essential for mechanistic understanding of arrhythmogenesis, since cells are subjected to rapid periodic stimulation during many arrhythmias.},

This is achieved by characterizing the admissible region of flux distributions in steady state. This region is spanned by what can be called a convex basis. The concept of 'elementary flux modes' provides a mathematical tool to define all metabolic routes that are feasible in a given metabolic network. In addition, we define 'enzyme subsets' to be groups of enzymes that operate together in fixed flux proportions in all steady states of the system. RESULTS: Algorithms for computing the convex basis and elementary modes developed earlier are briefly reviewed. A newly developed algorithm for detecting all enzyme subsets in a given network is presented. All of these algorithms have been implemented in a novel computer program named METATOOL, whose features are outlined here. The algorithms are illustrated by an example taken from sugar metabolism.

However, for some reactions it is necessary to use the more complicated steady-state rate equations. Thermodynamics is used in rapid-equilibrium derivations to calculate the equilibrium concentrations of reactants up to the rate-determining reaction, and that means that the reactions in the mechanism have to be independent. This is quite different from steady-state treatments of mechanisms where reactions do not have to be independent. The innovation in this article is the use of half-reactions to construct complete rapid-equilibrium rate equations. Five half-reactions are described. Any forward half-reaction can be combined with any reverse half-reaction. Rapid-equilibrium rate equations are given for fifteen mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, but more rate equations can be constructed from these five half-reactions.},

Exchange of 32P from α-d-glycopyranose 1-phosphate (glucose-1-P) into Pi and exchange of 14C from glucose-1-P into glycogen were followed simultaneously by the use of glucose-1-P containing both isotopes. Concentrations of glucose-1-P and Pi were varied together in their equilibrium ratio at constant glycogen concentration, and the concentration of glycogen was varied at fixed concentrations of phosphates. Exchange rates for the two isotopes were equal under all conditions (with the possible exception of measurements at the highest concentrations of the phosphates) and gave linear reciprocal plots. One exception was noted in which the reciprocal plot was concave upward at low concentrations of substrate, probably because of allosteric effects. The results support a rapid equilibrium mechanism.
Initial velocity of the reaction in the absence of product was determined by the use of an isotopic assay. The results were characteristic of a sequential mechanism.
Isotope-exchange rates were also determined under nonequilibrium conditions. Exchange of 32P from glucose-1-P into Pi was followed as a function of glycogen concentration at a fixed concentration of glucose-1-P and several fixed concentrations of Pi. The exchange was also followed as a function of glucose-1-P concentration at fixed glycogen concentration and several fixed Pi concentrations. Similar experiments were done while following the exchange from Pi into glucose-1-P. These experiments are equivalent to conventional product inhibition experiments. The results indicate that the two phosphates are noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to glycogen, but are competitive with respect to one another.
Our conclusion is that phosphorylase a has a rapid equilibrium Random Bi-Bi mechanism involving binary complexes of enzyme with glycogen, glucose-1-P, and Pi, and ternary complexes of enzyme with glycogen and glucose-1-P and with glycogen and Pi.},

The basic idea of this approach is to apply the rapid-equilibrium approximation commonly used in the mathematical modelling of metabolic systems (cf. [1] for lumping into single “pool variables” all those reactive groups which can be labeled and which are connected by fast reversible reactions. The set of remaining slow reactions governing the dynamics of the reduced system of pool variables depends on the special way of labeling chosen. Thus, the reduction procedure permits to judge the maximal possible number of flux rates which can be estimated from stationary or time-dependent tracer experiments by regression analysis (fitting). Moreover, the method can be employed for identifying near-equilibrium and nonequilibrium reactions. An illustration of the reduction algorithm is provided by considering the distribution of 14C-tracers in the pentose phosphate pathway.},

Cross-bridge models of muscle are biophysically based but computationally expensive to solve, and thus unsuitable for embedding in spatially distributed continuum representations. Fading memory models are computationally efficient but provide limited biophysical insight. In this study a novel computational method is proposed for coupling these two frameworks such that biophysical events can be determined and computational tractability maintained. Within the cross-bridge model, the functional forms of the distribution of cross-bridges, as a function of strain in each state, are approximated using the distribution moment approach. Using the variables of area, mean and standard deviation of each distribution, analytic expressions are developed to calculate the temporal dynamics of stiffness, tension and energy. A root finding method is employed to adjust the variables such that the temporal dynamics of the cross-bridge model match those of an equivalent fading memory model. The method is demonstrated for sinusoidal perturbations in length at two frequencies, with an approximate 30-fold increase in computational efficiency over a conventional technique for finding a solution to the cross-bridge model.},

	abstract = {Na/K pump current was determined between -140 and +60 mV as steady-state, strophanthidin-sensitive, whole-cell current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes, voltage-clamped and internally dialyzed via wide-tipped pipettes. Solutions were designed to minimize all other components of membrane current. A device for exchanging the solution inside the pipette permitted investigation of Na/K pump current-voltage (I-V) relationships at several levels of pipette [Na] [( Na]pip) in a single cell; the effects of changes in external [Na] [( Na]o) or external [K] [( K]o) were also studied. At 50 mM [Na]pip, 5.4 mM [K]o, and approximately 150 mM [Na]o, Na/K pump current was steeply voltage dependent at negative potentials but was approximately constant at positive potentials. Under those conditions, reduction of [Na]o enhanced pump current at negative potentials but had little effect at positive potentials: at zero [Na]o, pump current was only weakly voltage dependent. At 5.4 mM [K]o and approximately 150 mM [Na]o, reduction of [Na]pip from 50 mM scaled down the sigmoid pump I-V relationship and shifted it slightly to the right (toward more positive potentials). Pump current at 0 mV was activated by [Na]pip according to the Hill equation with best-fit K0.5 approximately equal to 11 mM and Hill coefficient nH approximately equal to 1.4. At zero [Na]o, reduction of [Na]pip seemed to simply scale down the relatively flat pump I-V relationship: Hill fit parameters for pump activation by [Na]pip at 0 mV were K0.5 approximately equal to 10 mM, nH approximately equal to 1.4. At 50 mM [Na]pip and high [Na]o, reduction of [K]o from 5.4 mM scaled down the sigmoid I-V relationship and shifted it slightly to the right: at 0 mV, K0.5 approximately equal to 1.5 mM and nH approximately equal to 1.0. At zero [Na]o, lowering [K]o simply scaled down the flat pump I-V relationships yielding, at 0 mV, K0.5 approximately equal to 0.2 mM, nH approximately equal to 1.1. The voltage-independent activation of Na/K pump current by both intracellular Na ions and extracellular K ions, at zero [Na]o, suggests that neither ion binds within the membrane field. Extracellular Na ions, however, seem to have both a voltage-dependent and a voltage-independent influence on the Na/K pump: they inhibit outward Na/K pump current in a strongly voltage-dependent fashion, with higher apparent affinity at more negative potentials (K0.5 approximately equal to 90 mM at -120 mV, and approximately 170 mM at -80 mV), and they compete with extracellular K ions in a seemingly voltage-independent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Whole-cell currents were recorded in guinea pig ventricular myocytes at approximately 36 degrees C before, during, and after exposure to maximally effective concentrations of strophanthidin, a cardiotonic steroid and specific inhibitor of the Na/K pump. Wide-tipped pipettes, in combination with a device for exchanging the solution inside the pipette, afforded reasonable control of the ionic composition of the intracellular solution and of the membrane potential. Internal and external solutions were designed to minimize channel currents and Na/Ca exchange current while sustaining vigorous forward Na/K transport, monitored as strophanthidin-sensitive current. 100-ms voltage pulses from the -40 mV holding potential were used to determine steady-state levels of membrane current between -140 and +60 mV. Control experiments demonstrated that if the Na/K pump cycle were first arrested, e.g., by withdrawal of external K, or of both internal and external Na, then neither strophanthidin nor its vehicle, dimethylsulfoxide, had any discernible effect on steady-state membrane current. Further controls showed that, with the Na/K pump inhibited by strophanthidin, membrane current was insensitive to changes of external [K] between 5.4 and 0 mM and was little altered by changing the pipette [Na] from 0 to 50 mM. Strophanthidin-sensitive current therefore closely approximated Na/K pump current, and was virtually free of contamination by current components altered by the changes in extracellular [K] and intracellular [Na] expected to accompany pump inhibition. The steady-state Na/K pump current-voltage (I-V) relationship, with the pump strongly activated by 5.4 mM external K and 50 mM internal Na (and 10 mM ATP), was sigmoid in shape with a steep positive slope between about 0 and -100 mV, a less steep slope at more negative potentials, and an extremely shallow slope at positive potentials; no region of negative slope was found. That shape of I-V relationship can be generated by a two-state cycle with one pair of voltage-sensitive rate constants and one pair of voltage-insensitive rate constants: such a two-state scheme is a valid steady-state representation of a multi-state cycle that includes only a single voltage-sensitive step.},

	abstract = {Background— Intracellular sodium concentration ([Na+]i) modulates cardiac contractile and electrical activity through Na/Ca exchange (NCX). Upregulation of NCX in heart failure (HF) may magnify the functional impact of altered [Na+]i.
Methods and Results— We measured [Na+]i by using sodium binding benzofuran isophthalate in control and HF rabbit ventricular myocytes (HF induced by aortic insufficiency and constriction). Resting [Na+]i was 9.7±0.7 versus 6.6±0.5 mmol/L in HF versus control. In both cases, [Na+]i increased by ≈2 mmol/L when myocytes were stimulated (0.5 to 3 Hz). To identify the mechanisms responsible for [Na+]i elevation in HF, we measured the [Na+]i dependence of Na/K pump–mediated Na+ extrusion. There was no difference in Vmax (8.3±0.7 versus 8.0±0.8 mmol/L/min) or Km (9.2±1.0 versus 9.9±0.8 mmol/L in HF and control, respectively). Therefore, at measured [Na+]i levels, the Na/K pump rate is actually higher in HF. However, resting Na+ influx was twice as high in HF versus control (2.3±0.3 versus 1.1±0.2 mmol/L/min), primarily the result of a tetrodotoxin-sensitive pathway.
Conclusions— Myocyte [Na+]i is elevated in HF as a result of higher diastolic Na+ influx (with unaltered Na/K-ATPase characteristics). In HF, the combined increased [Na+]i, decreased Ca2+ transient, and prolonged action potential all profoundly affect cellular Ca2+ regulation, promoting greater Ca2+ influx through NCX during action potentials. Notably, the elevated [Na+]i may be critical in limiting the contractile dysfunction observed in HF.},

	abstract = {Like several other ion transporters, the Na+-K+ pump of animal cells is electrogenic. The pump generates the pump current I p. Under physiological conditions, I p is an outward current. It can be measured by electrophysiological methods. These methods permit the study of characteristics of the Na+-K+ pump in its physiological environment, i.e., in the cell membrane. The cell membrane, across which a potential gradient exists, separates the cytosol and extracellular medium, which have distinctly different ionic compositions. The introduction of the patch-clamp techniques and the enzymatic isolation of cells have facilitated the investigation of I p in single cardiac myocytes. This review summarizes and discusses the results obtained from I p measurements in isolated cardiac cells. These results offer new exciting insights into the voltage and ionic dependence of the Na+-K+ pump activity, its effect on membrane potential, and its modulation by hormones, transmitters, and drugs. They are fundamental for our current understanding of Na+-K+ pumping in electrically excitable cells.},

	abstract = {Calculation of the thermodynamic properties of biomolecules at high temperatures and pressures is fundamental to understanding the biogeochemistry of hydrothermal systems. Ample evidence indicates that hyperthermophilic microbes interact chemically with their mineralogical environment in these systems. Nevertheless, little is known about the thermodynamic properties of the biomolecules involved in such processes. Recent advances in theoretical biogeochemistry make it possible to calculate these properties using the limited experimental data available in the literature, together with correlation and group additivity algorithms, reference model compounds, and the revised HKF equations of state. This approach permits calculation of the standard molal thermodynamic properties of the 120 common protonated and deprotonated nucleotides and their constituent nucleic-acid bases and nucleosides as a function of temperature and pressure. The requisite equations of state parameters can be calculated from experimental standard molal heat capacities, volumes, and compressibilities reported in the literature for nucleic-acid bases and nucleosides. Because no calorimetric or densimetric data are available for the nucleotides, experimental heats of reaction taken from the literature were used together with correlation and group additivity algorithms to generate provisional values of the corresponding equations of state parameters for the nucleotides. The thermodynamic properties and revised HKF equations of state parameters generated in the present study can be used to carry out comprehensive mass transfer and Gibbs energy calculations to describe and quantify the chemical interaction of minerals and microbes in hydrothermal systems.},

	abstract = {The ErbB signaling pathways, which regulate diverse physiological responses such as cell survival, proliferation and motility, have been subjected to extensive molecular analysis. Nonetheless, it remains poorly understood how different ligands induce different responses and how this is affected by oncogenic mutations. To quantify signal flow through ErbB‐activated pathways we have constructed, trained and analyzed a mass action model of immediate‐early signaling involving ErbB1–4 receptors (EGFR, HER2/Neu2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), and the MAPK and PI3K/Akt cascades. We find that parameter sensitivity is strongly dependent on the feature (e.g. ERK or Akt activation) or condition (e.g. EGF or heregulin stimulation) under examination and that this context dependence is informative with respect to mechanisms of signal propagation. Modeling predicts log‐linear amplification so that significant ERK and Akt activation is observed at ligand concentrations far below the Kd for receptor binding. However, MAPK and Akt modules isolated from the ErbB model continue to exhibit switch‐like responses. Thus, key system‐wide features of ErbB signaling arise from nonlinear interaction among signaling elements, the properties of which appear quite different in context and in isolation.
Visual Overview
SynopsisThe four transmembrane receptors of the ErbB family, of which the epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase (EGFR or ErbB1) is the founding member, are widely expressed in human tissues and stimulate diverse cellular responses, such as proliferation, survival and motility. ErbB receptors have been studied extensively at a molecular level and several have been shown to play a central role in human cancer. ErbB2 (Her2), for example, is overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers and is the target of trastuzumab, an important anticancer drug. Signaling through ErbB receptors, and the downstream proteins they activate, is complex because ErbB1–4 combine to form both homo‐ and heterodimers having distinct affinities for 13 known ligands and intracellular adaptor proteins. Understanding and predicting how signaling varies with receptor mutation or overexpression is essentially impossible using informal reasoning and pictorial representations of signaling pathways.To address this challenge, we have constructed, trained and analyzed a mass action model of immediate‐early signaling involving four ErbB receptors, as well as the downstream MAP kinase and PI3K–Akt signaling pathways involved in regulating cell proliferation (Figure 1). Our model aims to capture as much mechanistic information as possible, based on an extensive literature, while accurately representing the responses of cells to two major ligand subclasses (EGF and heregulin in multiple tumor cell types). In assembling such a model, we encounter a number of challenges, among which the processes of entraining models to experimental data are the most serious. Mass action models are governed by two kinds of parameters: the concentrations of individual protein species, and the rate constants governing protein–protein association and enzyme catalysis. Models of cell signaling that are realistic at a molecular level may inevitably contain many parameters that are unknown a priori. These parameters can be estimated either by direct measurement (usually in vitro, raising the question how values obtained in dilute solution should be translated to a crowded intracellular environment) or through an inverse process in which the model is fitted to data. The processes of training a kinetic model on experimental data constrain only a subset of parameters. It is assumed by some that the presence of parametric uncertainty in trained models makes them useless; in fact the aim of fitting is to determine only the subset of parameters that determine model performance with sufficient accuracy from which meaningful hypotheses can be drawn. Methods to accomplish this with cell signaling models are in their infancy, and most biochemical models are parameterized based on generic or theoretical assumptions; systematic or rigorous analysis of parameters variation and uncertainty has been restricted to small idealized models. In the current study, we use iterative fitting to generate families of model fits with similar biochemical connectivity, but different values for unconstrained parameters. We then attempt to draw well‐substantiated inferences from the families of models.To ascertain which features of our ErbB model are conserved when parameterized by different sets of rate constants and concentrations, we calculated dynamic sensitivities of multiple observables; this serves to measure the ‘importance’ of each rate or species in affecting measurable outputs. Sensitivity analysis showed that despite degeneracy in parameter values among families of fits, many important features are conserved. However, the rank order of sensitive parameters is strongly influenced by the feature being examined. For example, the proteins and rate constants that influence ERK activation differed from those that influence Akt, and factors important at high ligand concentrations differ from those important at low concentrations. A picture of ErbB signaling emerges in which different physiological outputs can be mapped back to specific biochemical characteristics of signaling proteins under varying input conditions.One striking aspect of this input–output behavior involves the relationship between ligand concentration (the input) and the activities of ERK or Akt (the output). A priori, we might assume little activation of the ErbB pathway when the concentration of ligand is below receptor Kd. However, experiments demonstrate significant Akt and ERK activation (∼20\% maximal) and 100‐fold lower ligand. Moreover, as ligand levels rise we would expect the response to rise ∼9‐fold for every 81‐fold increase in ligand concentrations (representing standard binding thermodynamics). In contrast, we observe a log‐linear amplification relationship between ligand and output over a nearly 106 concentration range (Figure 7). To understand how this might arise, we have examined the performance of our parameterized ErbB model of and subsets of model comprising coupled reactions such as the MAP kinase cascade. We conclude that the unexpected log‐linear input–output behavior of the ErbB model arises from interactions between enzyme cascades that in isolation exhibit canonical Hill‐like behavior. Thus, we must now think carefully about the ways in which signaling modules interact so as to generate behavior that is quite different from what we would expect of the isolated molecules or small cascades.In conclusion, we describe an approach in constructing and analyzing models of cell signaling pathways that can incorporate substantial molecular detail, while remaining sensitive to the inability of experiments to fully constrain parametric complexity. By focusing on well‐substantiated model features, we attempt to understand the origins of an unexpected and physiologically significant characteristic of the ErbB network with regard to dose–response behavior. Looking forward we anticipate building on the current model by including more accurate representations of more reactions, while developing a rigorous approach to generating model‐derived hypotheses, the degree of belief of which is determined by the underlying uncertainty in the model and the data. We will then be in a position to reliably understand cellular physiology in terms of molecular mechanism.
A complex mass‐action model of immediate‐early ErbB signaling in human cells yields new biochemical insight despite its non‐identifiability and resulting parametric uncertaintySensitivity analysis reveals a strong relationship between those parameters that are important for model dynamics and the specific physiological feature being analyzed: biochemical values that are highly significant for some responses are unimportant for othersProteins downstream in the ErbB signaling cascade are activated to substantial levels at ligand concentrations several orders of magnitude below those that result in appreciable receptor‐ligand binding or receptor phosphorylationThe extreme sensitivity of ErbB receptors to low ligand concentrations arises from the ability of MAPK and PI3K‐Akt kinase cascades to amplify signals in a highly non‐linear manner; this behavior is lost when the cascades are isolated from the larger ErbB network, demonstrating context sensitivity in their operation},

	abstract = {As modeling becomes a more widespread practice in the life sciences and biomedical sciences, researchers need reliable tools to calibrate models against ever more complex and detailed data. Here we present an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework and software environment, ABC-SysBio, which is a Python package that runs on Linux and Mac OS X systems and that enables parameter estimation and model selection in the Bayesian formalism by using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches. We outline the underlying rationale, discuss the computational and practical issues and provide detailed guidance as to how the important tasks of parameter inference and model selection can be performed in practice. Unlike other available packages, ABC-SysBio is highly suited for investigating, in particular, the challenging problem of fitting stochastic models to data. In order to demonstrate the use of ABC-SysBio, in this protocol we postulate the existence of an imaginary reaction network composed of seven interrelated biological reactions (involving a specific mRNA, the protein it encodes and a post-translationally modified version of the protein), a network that is defined by two files containing 'observed' data that we provide as supplementary information. In the first part of the PROCEDURE, ABC-SysBio is used to infer the parameters of this system, whereas in the second part we use ABC-SysBio's relevant functionality to discriminate between two different reaction network models, one of them being the 'true' one. Although computationally expensive, the additional insights gained in the Bayesian formalism more than make up for this cost, especially in complex problems.

However, the dynamics of biochemical systems are generally non-linear, suggesting that suitable non-linear formulations may offer gains with respect to causal network inference and aid in associated prediction problems.
Results: We present a general framework for network inference and dynamical prediction using time course data that is rooted in non-linear biochemical kinetics. This is achieved by considering a dynamical system based on a chemical reaction graph with associated kinetic parameters. Both the graph and kinetic parameters are treated as unknown; inference is carried out within a Bayesian framework. This allows prediction of dynamical behavior even when the underlying reaction graph itself is unknown or uncertain. Results, based on (i) data simulated from a mechanistic model of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and (ii) phosphoproteomic data from cancer cell lines, demonstrate that non-linear formulations can yield gains in causal network inference and permit dynamical prediction and uncertainty quantification in the challenging setting where the reaction graph is unknown.

The method involves the generation of a complete dictionary of polynomial basis functions based on the law of mass action. Using these basis functions, there are two approaches to model construction, namely the general to specific and the specific to general approach.

	abstract = {Networks of organic chemical reactions are important in life and probably played a central part in its origin. Network dynamics regulate cell division, circadian rhythms, nerve impulses and chemotaxis, and guide the development of organisms. Although out-of-equilibrium networks of chemical reactions have the potential to display emergent network dynamics such as spontaneous pattern formation, bistability and periodic oscillations, the principles that enable networks of organic reactions to develop complex behaviours are incompletely understood. Here we describe a network of biologically relevant organic reactions (amide formation, thiolate–thioester exchange, thiolate–disulfide interchange and conjugate addition) that displays bistability and oscillations in the concentrations of organic thiols and amides. Oscillations arise from the interaction between three subcomponents of the network: an autocatalytic cycle that generates thiols and amides from thioesters and dialkyl disulfides; a trigger that controls autocatalytic growth; and inhibitory processes that remove activating thiol species that are produced during the autocatalytic cycle. In contrast to previous studies that have demonstrated oscillations and bistability using highly evolved biomolecules (enzymes and DNA) or inorganic molecules of questionable biochemical relevance (for example, those used in Belousov–Zhabotinskii-type reactions), the organic molecules we use are relevant to metabolism and similar to those that might have existed on the early Earth. By using small organic molecules to build a network of organic reactions with autocatalytic, bistable and oscillatory behaviour, we identify principles that explain the ways in which dynamic networks relevant to life could have developed. Modifications of this network will clarify the influence of molecular structure on the dynamics of reaction networks, and may enable the design of biomimetic networks and of synthetic self-regulating and evolving chemical systems.},

	abstract = {The observed standard free energy change (ΔG0obs) for the hydrolysis of the terminal pyrophosphate bond of ATP has been experimentally determined under physiological conditions using an entirely new set of reactions. The observed equilibrium constant (Kobs) for the combined reactions of acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) and phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.8) has been determined at 38°, pH 7.0, ionic strength 0.25, and varying free [Mg2+]. The Kobs of these combined reactions reflects the difference between ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA and the ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of ATP. Using Σ and square brackets to indicate total concentration,
Kobs = [ΣADP][ΣPi]/[ΣATP] x [Acetyl-CoA]/[ΣAcetate][CoA]
The observed value of this combined equilibrium constant varies with free [Mg2+], being 0.984 ± 0.009 when [Mg2+] = 0 and 0.218 ± 0.002 when free [Mg2+] = 10-3 m. The ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA is virtually unaffected by the free [Mg2+] and has been previously determined to be -8.54 Cal per mole (-35.75 kJ per mole) under the same conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Therefore at pH 7.0, at ionic strength 0.25, at 38°, and taking the standard state of liquid water to have activity = unity ([H2O] = 1) the ΔG0obs for the reaction
[see PDF for equation]
can be calculated to be -8.53 Cal per mole (-35.69 kJ per mole) at [Mg2+] = 0 and -7.60 Cal per mole (-31.80 kJ per mole) at [Mg2+] = 10-3 m. The corresponding values of Kobs for the ATP hydrolysis reaction are 9.86 x 105 m ([Mg2+] = 0) and 2.19 x 105 m ([Mg2+] = 10-3 m). Equations have been developed for calculating from the experimental data the ΔG0obs of ATP hydrolysis at different free magnesium and hydrogen ion concentrations.
The Kobs of ATP hydrolysis has been used in combination with the Kobs of the citrate synthase reaction (EC 4.1.3.7) to calculate the Kobs of the ATP-citrate lyase reaction (EC 4.1.3.8)
Kobs = [ΣADP][Acetyl-CoA] [ΣPi] [ΣOxaloacetate]/[ΣATP] [CoA] [ΣCitrate]
Under the same near physiological conditions of 38°, pH 7.0, and ionic strength 0.25, the value of Kobs for the ATP-citrate lyase reaction was found to be very sensitive to the free [Mg2+], being 0.975 m at [Mg2+] = 0 and 0.0985 m when free [Mg2+] = 10-3 m.},

These tools need to be able to quantify the differences and similarities between computational models. However, depending on the specific application, the notion of ‘similarity’ may greatly vary. A general notion of model similarity, applicable to various types of models, is still missing. Here we survey existing methods for the comparison of models, introduce quantitative measures for model similarity, and discuss potential applications of combined similarity measures. To frame model comparison as a general problem, we describe a theoretical approach to defining and computing similarities based on a combination of different model aspects. The six aspects that we define as potentially relevant for similarity are underlying encoding, references to biological entities, quantitative behaviour, qualitative behaviour, mathematical equations and parameters and network structure. We argue that future similarity measures will benefit from combining these model aspects in flexible, problem-specific ways to mimic users’ intuition about model similarity, and to support complex model searches in databases.},

Although metabolic biochemical pathways are well understood, less is known about precisely how reaction rates or fluxes through the various enzymes are controlled. Hackett et al. developed a method to quantitate such regulatory influence in yeast. They monitored concentrations of metabolites, enzymes, and potential regulators by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry) and isotope ratio measurements for 56 reactions, over 100 metabolites, and 370 metabolic enzymes in yeast in 25 different steady-state conditions. Bayesian analysis was used to examine the probability of regulatory interactions. Regulation of flux through the pathways was predominantly controlled by changes in the concentration of small-molecule metabolites rather than changes in enzyme abundance. The analysis also revealed previously unrecognized regulation between pathways.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONMetabolism is among the most strongly conserved processes across all domains of life and is crucial for both bioengineering and disease research, yet we still have an unclear understanding of how metabolic rates (fluxes) are determined. Qualitatively, this deficiency involves missing knowledge of enzyme regulators. Quantitatively, it involves limited understanding of the relative contributions of enzyme and metabolite concentrations in controlling flux across physiological conditions. Addressing these gaps has been challenging because in vitro biochemical approaches lack the physiological context, whereas models of cellular metabolic dynamics have limited capacity for identifying or quantitating specific regulatory events because of overall model complexity.
RATIONALEFlux through individual metabolic reactions is directly determined by the concentrations of enzyme, substrates, products, and any allosteric regulators, as captured quantitatively by a Michaelis-Menten–style reaction equation. Analogous to how experimental variation of reaction species in vitro allows for the inference of regulators and reaction equation kinetic parameters, physiological changes in flux entail a change in reaction species that can be used to determine reaction equations on the basis of cellular data. This requires measurement across multiple biological conditions of flux, enzyme concentrations, and metabolite concentrations. We reasoned that chemostat cultures could be used to induce predictable and strong flux changes, with changes in enzymes and metabolites measurable by proteomics and metabolomics. By directly relating cellular flux to the reaction species that determine it, we can carry out regulatory inference at the level of single metabolic reactions by using cellular data. An important benefit is that the physiological significance of any identified regulator is implicit from its role in determining cellular flux.
RESULTSHere we introduce systematic identification of meaningful metabolic enzyme regulation (SIMMER). We measured fluxes, and metabolite and enzyme concentrations, in each of 25 yeast chemostats. For each of 56 reactions for which the flux, enzyme, and substrates were measured, we determined whether variation in measured flux could be explained by simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We also evaluated alternative models of each reaction’s kinetics that included a suite of allosteric regulators drawn from across all organisms. For 46 reactions, we were able to identify a useful kinetic model, with 17 reactions not including any regulation and 29 reactions being regulated by one to two allosteric regulators. Three previously unrecognized cross-pathway regulatory interactions were validated biochemically. These included inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate and inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylase by phenypyruvate. These metabolites accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow and ethanol production in nitrogen-limited yeast. For well-supported reaction forms, we were able to determine the extent to which nutrient-based changes in flux were determined by changes in the concentrations of individual reaction species. We find that substrates are the most important determinant of fluxes in general, with enzymes and allosteric regulators having a comparably important role in the case of physiologically irreversible reactions.
CONCLUSIONBy connecting changes in flux to their root cause, SIMMER parallels classic in vitro approaches, but it allows simultaneous testing of numerous regulators of many reactions under physiological conditions. Its application to yeast showed that changes in flux across nutrient conditions are predominantly due to metabolite, not enzyme, levels. Thus, yeast metabolism is substantially self-regulating. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/354/6311/aaf2786/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Integrative analysis of fluxes and metabolite and enzyme concentrations by SIMMER.Measured flux is related, on a reaction-by-reaction basis, to enzyme and metabolite concentrations through a Michaelis-Menten equation. The extent to which variation in flux across experimental conditions can be explained by the enzyme, substrates, and products is assessed. If unregulated kinetics disagrees with the measured flux, we test a set of possible allosteric regulators to determine which, if any, regulators are supported on the basis of improvement in fit.
Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on enzyme kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and enzyme concentrations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured enzyme and metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between enzyme, substrate, product, and potential regulator concentrations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate concentrations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite concentrations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of enzymes.
Metabolomics, proteomics, and flux analysis are used to dissect quantitatively metabolic regulation in living yeast.

Various rules of thumb for nonredundant models are examined. The Counting Rule states that a model is quantitatively testable if and only if it has fewer parameters than observables. This rule can be safely applied only to identifiable models. If a model is unidentifiable, one must apply a generalization of the Counting Rule known as the Jacobian Rule. This rule states that a model is quantitatively testable if and only if the maximum rank (i.e., the number of linearly independent columns) of its Jacobian matrix (i.e., the matrix of partial derivatives of the function that maps parameter values to the predicted values of observables) is smaller than the number of observables. The Identifiability Rule states that a model is identifiable if and only if the maximum rank of its Jacobian matrix equals the number of parameters. The conclusions provided by these rules are only presumptive. To reach definitive conclusions, additional analyses must be performed.

* The complexity of computational models is increasing, supported by research in modelling tools and frameworks. But relatively little thought has gone into design principles for complex models.

* We propose a set of design principles for complex model construction with the Physiome standard modelling protocol CellML.

* By following the principles, models are generated that are extensible and are themselves suitable for reuse in larger models of increasing complexity.

* We illustrate these principles with examples including an architectural prototype linking, for the first time, electrophysiology, thermodynamically compliant metabolism, signal transduction, gene regulation and synthetic biology.

* The design principles complement other Physiome research projects, facilitating the application of virtual experiment protocols and model analysis techniques to assist the modelling community in creating libraries of composable, characterised and simulatable quantitative descriptions of physiology.



Abstract

The ability to produce and customise complex computational models has great potential to have a positive impact on human health. As the field develops towards whole-cell models and linking such models in multi-scale frameworks to encompass tissue, organ, or organism levels, reuse of previous modelling efforts will become increasingly necessary. Any modelling group wishing to reuse existing computational models as modules for their own work faces many challenges in the context of construction, storage, retrieval, documentation and analysis of such modules. Physiome standards, frameworks and tools seek to address several of these challenges, especially for models expressed in the modular protocol CellML. Aside from providing a general ability to produce modules, there has been relatively little research work on architectural principles of CellML models that will enable reuse at larger scales. To complement and support the existing tools and frameworks, we develop a set of principles to address this consideration. The principles are illustrated with examples that couple electrophysiology, signalling, metabolism, gene regulation and synthetic biology, together forming an architectural prototype for whole-cell modelling (including human intervention) in CellML. Such models illustrate how testable units of quantitative biophysical simulation can be constructed. Finally, future relationships between modular models so constructed and Physiome frameworks and tools are discussed, with particular reference to how such frameworks and tools can in turn be extended to complement and gain more benefit from the results of applying the principles.},

Building and managing these complex models is a major challenge that can benefit from the application of formal methods adopted from theoretical computing science. Here we provide a general introduction to the field of formal modelling, which emphasizes the intuitive biochemical basis of the modelling process, but is also accessible for an audience with a background in computing science and/or model engineering. We show how signal transduction cascades can be modelled in a modular fashion, using both a qualitative approach—qualitative Petri nets, and quantitative approaches—continuous Petri nets and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We review the major elementary building blocks of a cellular signalling model, discuss which critical design decisions have to be made during model building, and present a number of novel computational tools that can help to explore alternative modular models in an easy and intuitive manner. These tools, which are based on Petri net theory, offer convenient ways of composing hierarchical ODE models, and permit a qualitative analysis of their behaviour. We illustrate the central concepts using signal transduction as our main example. The ultimate aim is to introduce a general approach that provides the foundations for a structured formal engineering of large-scale models of biochemical networks.},

	abstract = {Ion channels are membrane-bound enzymes whose catalytic sites are ion-conducting pores that open and close (gate) in response to specific environmental stimuli. Ion channels are important contributors to cell signaling and homeostasis. Our current understanding of gating is the product of 60 plus years of voltage-clamp recording augmented by intervention in the form of environmental, chemical, and mutational perturbations. The need for good phenomenological models of gating has evolved in parallel with the sophistication of experimental technique. The goal of modeling is to develop realistic schemes that not only describe data, but also accurately reflect mechanisms of action. This review covers three areas that have contributed to the understanding of ion channels: traditional Eyring kinetic theory, molecular dynamics analysis, and statistical thermodynamics. Although the primary emphasis is on voltage-dependent channels, the methods discussed here are easily generalized to other stimuli and could be applied to any ion channel and indeed any macromolecule.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model for the electrophysiological responses of a rabbit sinoatrial node cell that is based on whole cell recordings from enzymatically isolated single pacemaker cells at 37 degrees C has been developed. The ion channels, Na(+)-K+ and Ca2+ pumps, and Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger in the surface membrane (sarcolemma) are described using equations for these known currents in mammalian pacemaker cells. The extracellular environment is treated as a diffusion-limited space, and the myoplasm contains Ca(2+)-binding proteins (calmodulin and troponin). Original features of this model include 1) new equations for the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, 2) assessment of the role of the transient-type Ca2+ current during pacemaker depolarization, 3) inclusion of an Na+ current based on recent experimental data, and 4) demonstration of the possible influence of pump and exchanger currents and background currents on the pacemaker rate. This model provides acceptable fits to voltage-clamp and action potential data and can be used to seek biophysically based explanations of the electrophysiological activity in the rabbit sinoatrial node cell.},

	abstract = {Ageing and lifespan are strongly affected by metabolism. The maximal possible uptake of oxygen is not only a good predictor of performance in endurance sports, but also of life expectancy. Figuratively speaking, healthy ageing is a competitive sport. Although the root cause of ageing is damage to macromolecules, it is the balance with repair processes that is decisive. Reduced or intermittent nutrition, hormones and intracellular signalling pathways that regulate metabolism have strong effects on ageing. Homeostatic regulatory processes tend to keep the environment of the cells within relatively narrow bounds. On the other hand, the body is constantly adapting to physical activity and food consumption. Spontaneous fluctuations in heart rate and other processes indicate youth and health. A (homeo)dynamic aspect of homeostasis deteriorates with age. We are now in a position to develop computational models of human metabolism and the dynamics of heart rhythm and oxygen transport that will advance our understanding of ageing. Computational modelling of the connections between dietary restriction, metabolism and protein turnover may increase insight into homeostasis of the proteins in our body. In this way, the computational reconstruction of human physiological processes, the Physiome, can help prevent frailty and age-related disease.},

	abstract = {The cell therapy market is a highly volatile one, due to the use of disruptive technologies, the current economic situation and the small size of the market. In such a market, companies as well as academic research institutes are in need of tools to advance their understanding and, at the same time, reduce their R\&D costs, increase product quality and productivity, and reduce the time to market. An additional difficulty is the regulatory path that needs to be followed, which is challenging in the case of cell-based therapeutic products and should rely on the implementation of quality by design (QbD) principles. In silico modelling is a tool that allows the above-mentioned challenges to be addressed in the field of regenerative medicine. This review discusses such in silico models and focuses more specifically on the bioprocess. Three (clusters of) examples related to this subject are discussed. The first example comes from the pharmaceutical engineering field where QbD principles and their implementation through the use of in silico models are both a regulatory and economic necessity. The second example is related to the production of red blood cells. The described in silico model is mainly used to investigate the manufacturing process of the cell-therapeutic product, and pays special attention to the economic viability of the process. Finally, we describe the set-up of a model capturing essential events in the development of a tissue-engineered combination product in the context of bone tissue engineering. For each of the examples, a short introduction to some economic aspects is given, followed by a description of the in silico tool or tools that have been developed to allow the implementation of QbD principles and optimal design.},

	abstract = {We are currently in the middle of a major shift in biomedical research: unprecedented and rapidly growing amounts of data may be obtained today, from in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies, at molecular, physiological and clinical levels. To make use of these large-scale, multi-level datasets, corresponding multi-level mathematical models are needed, i.e. models that simultaneously capture multiple layers of the biological, physiological and disease-level organization (also referred to as quantitative systems pharmacology—QSP—models). However, today's multi-level models are not yet embedded in end-usage applications, neither in drug research and development nor in the clinic. Given the expectations and claims made historically, this seemingly slow adoption may seem surprising. Therefore, we herein consider a specific example—type 2 diabetes—and critically review the current status and identify key remaining steps for these models to become mainstream in the future. This overview reveals how, today, we may use models to ask scientific questions concerning, e.g., the cellular origin of insulin resistance, and how this translates to the whole-body level and short-term meal responses. However, before these multi-level models can become truly useful, they need to be linked with the capabilities of other important existing models, in order to make them ‘personalized’ (e.g. specific to certain patient phenotypes) and capable of describing long-term disease progression. To be useful in drug development, it is also critical that the developed models and their underlying data and assumptions are easily accessible. For clinical end-usage, in addition, model links to decision-support systems combined with the engagement of other disciplines are needed to create user-friendly and cost-efficient software packages.},

If quantitative methods, predicting patient-specific behaviour of these pathophysiology mechanisms, are to be brought to bear on clinical decision-making, the Human Physiome community and Clinical community must share a common computational blueprint for pathophysiology mechanisms. A number of obstacles stand in the way of this sharing—not least the technical and operational challenges that must be overcome to ensure that (i) the explicit biological meanings of the Physiome's quantitative methods to represent mechanisms are open to articulation, verification and study by clinicians, and that (ii) clinicians are given the tools and training to explicitly express disease manifestations in direct contribution to modelling. To this end, the Physiome and Clinical communities must co-develop a common computational toolkit, based on this blueprint, to bridge the representation of knowledge of pathophysiology mechanisms (a) that is implicitly depicted in electronic health records and the literature, with (b) that found in mathematical models explicitly describing mechanisms. In particular, this paper makes use of a step-wise description of a specific disease mechanism as a means to elicit the requirements of representing pathophysiological meaning explicitly. The computational blueprint developed from these requirements addresses the Clinical community goals to (i) organize and manage healthcare resources in terms of relevant disease-related knowledge of mechanisms and (ii) train the next generation of physicians in the application of quantitative methods relevant to their research and practice.},

Finally, we examine both the importance that muscles play in bone remodelling stimuli and the latest muscle force prediction methods that use electromyography-assisted modelling techniques to compute musculoskeletal forces that best reflect the underlying neuromuscular activity. Our proposal is that, in order to have a clinically relevant virtual physiological human, (i) bone and muscle mechanics must be considered together; (ii) models should be trained on population data to permit rapid generation and use underlying principal modes that describe both muscle patterns and morphology; and (iii) these tools need to be available in an open-source repository so that the scientific community may use, personalize and contribute to the database of models.},

	abstract = {The goal of developing therapies and dosage regimes for characterized subgroups of the general population can be facilitated by the use of simulation models able to incorporate information about inter-individual variability in drug disposition (pharmacokinetics), toxicity and response effect (pharmacodynamics). Such observed variability can have multiple causes at various scales, ranging from gross anatomical differences to differences in genome sequence. Relevant data for many of these aspects, particularly related to molecular assays (known as ‘-omics’), are available in online resources, but identification and assignment to appropriate model variables and parameters is a significant bottleneck in the model development process. Through its efforts to standardize annotation with consequent increase in data usability, the human physiome project has a vital role in improving productivity in model development and, thus, the development of personalized therapy regimes. Here, we review the current status of personalized medicine in clinical practice, outline some of the challenges that must be overcome in order to expand its applicability, and discuss the relevance of personalized medicine to the more widespread challenges being faced in drug discovery and development. We then review some of (i) the key data resources available for use in model development and (ii) the potential areas where advances made within the physiome modelling community could contribute to physiologically based pharmacokinetic and physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling in support of personalized drug development. We conclude by proposing a roadmap to further guide the physiome community in its on-going efforts to improve data usability, and integration with modelling efforts in the support of personalized medicine development.},

This paper proposes a systematic methodology for the analysis of the mass and charge balances in dynamic models expressed using the Petersen matrix notation. This methodology is based on the definition of the model components via elemental mass fractions and in the estimation of the COD as a function of the redox equations associated with these elements. This approach makes the automatic calculation of all the stoichiometric coefficients under different measuring units and the study of COD, charge or mass fluxes easier. As an example of its application this methodology was applied to the ADM1 in order to illustrate its usefulness for the analysis of organic matter characterisation, nitrogen release or biogas composition in anaerobic digestion. The application of the methodology for a rigorous integration of different IWA models is proposed for further study.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Metabolic modelling provides a mathematically rigorous basis for system-level analysis of biochemical networks. However, the growing sizes of metabolic models can lead to serious problems in their construction and validation. In this work, we describe a relatively poorly investigated type of modelling error, called stoichiometric inconsistencies. These errors are caused by incorrect definitions of reaction stoichiometries and result in conflicts between two fundamental physical constraints to be satisfied by any valid metabolic model: positivity of molecular masses of all metabolites and mass conservation in all interconversions.
Results: We introduce formal definitions of stoichiometric inconsistencies, inconsistent net stoichiometries, elementary leakage modes and other important fundamental properties of incorrectly defined biomolecular networks. Algorithms are described for the verification of stoichiometric consistency of a model, detection of unconserved metabolites and inconsistent minimal net stoichiometries. The usefulness of these algorithms for effective resolving of inconsistencies and for detection of input errors is demonstrated on a published genome-scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and one of Streptococcus agalactiae constructed using the KEGG database.

Here, we present examples of metabolic networks in which there exist at least two reactions whose fluxes cannot be written as products and/or ratios of the stoichiometric coefficients of the network.

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death and enormous effort has focused at understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the decreased cardiac contractility. While changes of other components contribute, it is generally agreed that much of the contractile deficit is due to reduced myocyte Ca2+ transients.1,2 Alterations in Ca2+ current ( I Ca) and action potential characteristics are also seen in HF, but a central factor limiting Ca2+ transient amplitude is a decrease of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content.3–6 HF is extremely complex, but it is easy to appreciate how reduced SR Ca2+ content would reduce SR Ca2+ release, myofilament activation, and contractility. Despite agreement that SR Ca2+ content is reduced in HF, controversy exists about why SR content is low.

SR Ca2+ content reflects the balance between Ca2+ uptake (via SERCA) and Ca2+ efflux via ryanodine receptor (RyR). Thus, reduced SR content in HF must be due to reduced Ca2+ pumping by SERCA or increased SR Ca2+ leak via RyRs. Both are supported by experimental data (below). Transsarcolemmal Ca2+ fluxes also affect SR Ca2+ load. That is, reduced Ca2+ influx (eg, via I Ca) or enhanced Ca2+ extrusion via Na+-Ca2+ exchange (NCX) can unload the SR. Results are not unanimous, but most groups find little alteration in peak I Ca density in HF, while many find evidence of enhanced NCX expression and function.1,2 Increased NCX function can compete with SERCA during [Ca2+]i decline, extruding more Ca2+ from the cell and depleting the SR. In the new steady state, a larger fraction of activating Ca2+ also enters the cell at each beat in HF (eg, smaller Ca2+ release causes less …},

This model is used to investigate the energy consumed during a membrane action potential thus contributing to the current debate on the trade-off between the speed of an action potential event and energy consumption. The influx of Na+ is often taken as a proxy for energy consumption; in contrast, this paper presents an energy based model of action potentials. As the energy based approach avoids the assumptions underlying the proxy approach it can be directly used to compute energy consumption in both healthy and diseased neurons.

The model is based, whenever possible, on recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the possibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration [K]o. The fast sodium current, INa, is characterized by fast upstroke velocity (Vmax = 400 V/sec) and slow recovery from inactivation. The time-independent potassium current, IK1, includes a negative-slope phase and displays significant crossover phenomenon as [K]o is varied. The time-dependent potassium current, IK, shows only a minimal degree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates at plateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action potential duplicates the experimentally observed effects of changes in [K]o on action potential duration and rest potential. Physiological simulations focus on the interaction between depolarization and repolarization (i.e., premature stimulation). Results demonstrate the importance of the slow recovery of INa in determining the response of the cell. Simulated responses to periodic stimulation include monotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal [K]o, whereas at low [K]o nonmonotonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic patterns, and enhanced supernormal excitability that results in unstable responses ("chaotic activity") are observed. The results are consistent with recent experimental observations, and the model simulations relate these phenomena to the underlying ionic channel kinetics.},

	abstract = {Study of the excitatory sodium current (INa) intact heart muscle has been hampered by the limitations of voltage clamp methods in multicellular preparations that result from the presence of large series resistance and from extracellular ion accumulation and depletion. To minimize these problems we voltage clamped and internally perfused freshly isolated canine cardiac Purkinje cells using a large bore (25-microns diam) double-barreled flow-through glass suction pipette. Control of [Na+]i was demonstrated by the agreement of measured INa reversal potentials with the predictions of the Nernst relation. Series resistance measured by an independent microelectrode was comparable to values obtained in voltage clamp studies of squid axons (less than 3.0 omega-cm2). The rapid capacity transient decays (tau c less than 15 microseconds) and small deviations of membrane potential (less than 4 mV at peak INa) achieved in these experiments represent good conditions for the study of INa. We studied INa in 26 cells (temperature range 13 degrees-24 degrees C) with 120 or 45 mM [Na+]o and 15 mM [Na+]i. Time to peak INa at 18 degrees C ranged from 1.0 ms (-40 mV) to less than 250 microseconds (+ 40 mV), and INa decayed with a time course best described by two time constants in the voltage range -60 to -10 mV. Normalized peak INa in eight cells at 18 degrees C was 2.0 +/- 0.2 mA/cm2 with [Na+]o 45 mM and 4.1 +/- 0.6 mA/cm2 with [Na+]o 120 mM. These large peak current measurements require a high density of Na+ channels. It is estimated that 67 +/- 6 channels/micron 2 are open at peak INa, and from integrated INa as many as 260 Na+ channels/micron2 are available for opening in canine cardiac Purkinje cells.},

	abstract = {The cardiovascular system operates under demands ranging from conditions of rest to extreme stress. One mechanism of cardiac stress tolerance is action potential duration shortening driven by ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. KATP channel expression has a significant physiologic impact on action potential duration shortening and myocardial energy consumption in response to physiologic heart rate acceleration. However, the effect of reduced channel expression on action potential duration shortening in response to severe metabolic stress is yet to be established. Here, transgenic mice with myocardium-specific expression of a dominant negative KATP channel subunit were compared with littermate controls. Evaluation of KATP channel whole cell current and channel number/patch was assessed by patch clamp in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes. Monophasic action potentials were monitored in retrogradely perfused, isolated hearts during the transition to hypoxic perfusate. An 80–85\% reduction in cardiac KATP channel current density results in a similar magnitude, but significantly slower rate, of shortening of the ventricular action potential duration in response to severe hypoxia, despite no significant difference in coronary flow. Therefore, the number of functional cardiac sarcolemmal KATP channels is a critical determinant of the rate of adaptation of myocardial membrane excitability, with implications for optimization of cardiac energy consumption and consequent cardioprotection under conditions of severe metabolic stress.},

	abstract = {Calcium ion influx into the myocardial cell during the action potential initiates and controls the degree of contraction. The Ca++ influx leads to an increase of the myoplasmic free Ca++ concentration to about 10−5 molar for activation of the myofibrils; Ca++ may also be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by the entering Ca++ or by voltage change across its membrane. The inward Ca++ current during the action potential plateau traverses the sarcolemma through a separate set of slow cation channels that have some peculiar properties compared to fast sodium ion channels: Slow channels are not sensitive to tetrodotoxin, have lower activation and inactivation potentials and are kinetically slow (slow activation, inactivation and recovery processes). Slow Ca++ channels require metabolic energy and are blocked by verapamil, manganese ion, lanthanum ion and acidosis. When the fast Na++ channels are blocked by tetrodotoxin or voltage inactivated by 27 millimolar potassium ion, excitability is lost but can be restored by catecholamines and methylxanthines: Propagating slowly rising electrical responses (accompanied by contractions) occur that resemble the plateau of the normal action potential. Positive inotropic agents such as norepinephrine, theophylline and histamine appear to act by elevating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and increasing the number of Ca++ channels available for voltage activation. Increased cyclic AMP could lead to phosphorylation of a membrane protein constituent of the slow channels by means of a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Thus, the myocardial cell exercises control over the number of available slow channels and, hence, the Ca++ influx per impulse. This control mechanism could serve to protect the myocardial cell during periods of regional ischemia by acting to conserve ATP through reduced Ca++ influx and contraction, and thus preventing the affected cells from working themselves to death. The Ca++ channels in ischemic cells could be made inoperative by decreased ATP, decreased pH or accumulation of some other metabolite.},

And yet a principled framework to organize this knowledge has been missing. In this book, Peter Sterling and Simon Laughlin, two leading neuroscientists, strive to fill this gap, outlining a set of organizing principles to explain the whys of neural design that allow the brain to compute so efficiently. Setting out to "reverse engineer" the brain -- disassembling it to understand it -- Sterling and Laughlin first consider why an animal should need a brain, tracing computational abilities from bacterium to protozoan to worm. They examine bigger brains and the advantages of "anticipatory regulation"; identify constraints on neural design and the need to "nanofy"; and demonstrate the routes to efficiency in an integrated molecular system, phototransduction. They show that the principles of neural design at finer scales and lower levels apply at larger scales and higher levels; describe neural wiring efficiency; and discuss learning as a principle of biological design that includes "save only what is needed."Sterling and Laughlin avoid speculation about how the brain \textit{might} work and endeavor to make sense of what is already known. Their distinctive contribution is to gather a coherent set of basic rules and exemplify them across spatial and functional scales.},

	abstract = {During an action potential the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) activates rapidly, then partially declines leading to a sustained inward current during the plateau phase. The reason for the sustained part of ICa,L has been investigated here.In the present study the mechanisms controlling the ICa,L during an action potential were investigated quantitatively in isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes by whole-cell patch clamp. To measure the actual time courses of ICa,L and the corresponding L-type channel inactivation (fAP) during an action potential, action potential-clamp protocols combined with square pulses were applied.Within the first 10 ms of the action potential the ICa,L rapidly inactivated by about 50 \%; during the plateau phase inactivation proceeded to 95 \%. Later, during repolarization, the L-type channels recovered up to 25 \%.The voltage-dependent component of inactivation during an action potential was determined from measurements of L-type current carried by monovalent cations. This component of inactivation proceeded rather slowly and contributed only a little to fAP. ICa,L during an action potential is thus mainly controlled by Ca2+-dependent inactivation.In order to investigate the source of the Ca2+ controlling fAP, internal Ca2+ homeostasis was manipulated by the use of Ca2+ buffers (EGTA, BAPTA), by blocking Na+−Ca2+ exchange, or by blocking Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Internal BAPTA markedly reduced the L-type channel inactivation during the entire action potential, whereas EGTA affected fAP only during the middle and late plateau phases. Inhibition of Na+−Ca2+ exchange markedly increased inactivation of L-type channels. Although blocking SR Ca2+ release decreased the fura-2-measured cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transient by about 90 \%, it reduced L-type channel inactivation only during the initial 50 ms of the action potential. Thus, it is Ca2+ entering the cell through the L-type channels that controls the inactivation process for the majority of the action potential. Nevertheless, SR Ca2+-release contributes 40–50 \% to L-type channel inactivation during the initial period of the action potential. However, the maximum extent of inactivation reached during the plateau is independent of Ca2+ released from the SR.For the first time, the actual time course of L-type channel inactivation has been directly determined during an action potential under various defined [Ca2+]i conditions. Thereby, the relative contribution to ICa,L inactivation of voltage, Ca2+ entering through L-type channels, and Ca2+ being released from the SR could be directly demonstrated.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We develop a detailed Markov model of IKs and its alpha-subunit KCNQ1 and examine their kinetic properties during the cardiac ventricular action potential at different rates. We observe that interaction between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (the beta-subunit) confers kinetic properties on IKs that make it suitable for participation in action potential repolarization and its adaptation to rate changes; in particular, the channel develops an available reserve of closed states near the open state that can open rapidly on demand.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of its ability to form an available reserve, IKs can function as a repolarization reserve when IKr, the rapid delayed rectifier, is reduced by disease or drug and can prevent excessive action potential prolongation and development of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations.},

	abstract = {Calcium (Ca2+) plays many important regulatory roles in cardiac muscle cells. In the initial phase of the action potential, influx of Ca2+ through sarcolemmal voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (LCCs) acts as a feed-forward signal that triggers a large release of Ca2+ from the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This Ca2+ drives heart muscle contraction and pumping of blood in a process known as excitation–contraction coupling (ECC). Triggered and released Ca2+ also feed back to inactivate LCCs, attenuating the triggered Ca2+ signal once release has been achieved. The process of ECC consumes large amounts of ATP. It is now clear that in a process known as excitation–energetics coupling, Ca2+ signals exert beat-to-beat regulation of mitochondrial ATP production that closely couples energy production with demand. This occurs through transport of Ca2+ into mitochondria, where it regulates enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In excitation–signaling coupling, Ca2+ activates a number of signaling pathways in a feed-forward manner. Through effects on their target proteins, these interconnected pathways regulate Ca2+ signals in complex ways to control electrical excitability and contractility of heart muscle. In a process known as excitation–transcription coupling, Ca2+ acting primarily through signal transduction pathways also regulates the process of gene transcription. Because of these diverse and complex roles, experimentally based mechanistic computational models are proving to be very useful for understanding Ca2+ signaling in the cardiac myocyte.

	abstract = {Cardiac glycosides have been used for the treatment of heart failure because of their capabilities of inhibiting Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA), which raises [Na+]i and attenuates Ca2+ extrusion via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), causing [Ca2+]i elevation. The resulting [Ca2+]i accumulation further enhances Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, generating the positive inotropic effect. However, cardiac glycosides have some toxic and side effects such as arrhythmogenesis, confining their extensive clinical applications. The mechanisms underlying the proarrhythmic effect of glycosides are not fully understood. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which glycosides could cause cardiac arrhythmias via impairing mitochondrial energetics using an integrative computational cardiomyocyte model. In the simulations, the effect of glycosides was mimicked by blocking NKA activity. Results showed that inhibiting NKA not only impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ retention (thus suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging) but also enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (thus increased ROS production) during the transition of increasing workload, causing oxidative stress. Moreover, concurrent blocking of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, but not enhancing of Ca2+ uniporter, alleviated the adverse effects of NKA inhibition. Intriguingly, NKA inhibition elicited Ca2+ transient and action potential alternans under more stressed conditions such as severe ATP depletion, augmenting its proarrhythmic effect. This computational study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying cardiac glycoside-induced arrhythmogenesis. The findings suggest that targeting both ion handling and mitochondria could be a very promising strategy to develop new glycoside-based therapies in the treatment of heart failure.},

New measurement and modelling methods set the stage for control and systems theory to play their rôle in seeking out the mechanisms and principles that regulate life. It is of inestimable importance for the future of control as a discipline that this rôle is performed in the correct manner. If we handle the area wisely then living systems will present a seemingly boundless range of important new problems—just as physical and engineering systems have done in previous centuries.

Metabolic processes that regulate muscle energy use are major determinants of bodily energy balance. Here, we find that sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, which couple membrane excitability with cellular metabolic pathways, set muscle energy expenditure under physiological stimuli. Disruption of KATP channel function provoked, under conditions of unaltered locomotor activity and blood substrate availability, an extra energy cost of cardiac and skeletal muscle performance. Inefficient fuel metabolism in KATP channel-deficient striated muscles reduced glycogen and fat body depots, promoting a lean phenotype. The propensity to lesser body weight imposed by KATP channel deficit persisted under a high-fat diet, yet obesity restriction was achieved at the cost of compromised physical endurance. Thus, sarcolemmal KATP channels govern muscle energy economy, and their downregulation in a tissue-specific manner could present an antiobesity strategy by rendering muscle increasingly thermogenic at rest and less fuel efficient during exercise.},

	abstract = {Physical activity is one of the most important determinants of cardiac function. The ability of the heart to increase delivery of oxygen and metabolic fuels relies on an array of adaptive responses necessary to match bodily demand while avoiding exhaustion of cardiac resources. The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel has the unique ability to adjust cardiac membrane excitability in accordance with ATP and ADP levels, and up-regulation of its expression that occurs in response to exercise could represent a critical element of this adaption. However, the mechanism by which KATP channel expression changes result in a beneficial effect on cardiac excitability and function remains to be established. Here, we demonstrate that an exercise-induced rise in KATP channel expression enhanced the rate and magnitude of action potential shortening in response to heart rate acceleration. This adaptation in membrane excitability promoted significant reduction in cardiac energy consumption under escalating workloads. Genetic disruption of normal KATP channel pore function abolished the exercise-related changes in action potential duration adjustment and caused increased cardiac energy consumption. Thus, an expression-driven enhancement in the KATP channel-dependent membrane response to alterations in cardiac workload represents a previously unrecognized mechanism for adaptation to physical activity and a potential target for cardioprotection.},

Each action potential comes at a cost: the brain uses a substantial portion of its total energy budget to generate and propagate action potentials. Recent results show that some mammalian action potentials have biophysical properties that make them energy efficient. Yet, how widespread are energy efficient action potentials? Using mathematical analysis and modeling, we show that there is no direct relationship between the height, width, and the energy consumption of a single action potential. Furthermore, we establish that many mammalian action potentials have biophysical properties that reduce the overlap between their inward and outward currents so as to minimize energy consumption. This reduction in overlap results from a combination of ion channel properties uniquely tailored for each particular neuron type and the functional purpose of the action potential in that neuron. By comparing the measured biophysical parameters to the parameters produced by numerical optimization for maximal energy-efficiency, we argue that natural selection for energy-efficiency could help explain both the shape of the action potential and the underlying biophysics of ionic currents.},

	abstract = {The relationships between Na/K pump activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were determined in isolated rat brain synaptosomes. The activity of the enzyme was modulated by altering [K+]e, [Na+]i, and [ATP]i while synaptosomal oxygen uptake and lactate production were measured simultaneously. KCl increased respiration and glycolysis with an apparent Km of about 1 mM which suggests that, at the [K+]e normally present in brain, 3.3-4 mM, the pump is near saturation with this cation. Depolarization with 6-40 mM KCl had negligible effect on ouabain-sensitive O2 uptake indicating that at the voltages involved the activity of the Na/K ATPase is largely independent of membrane potential. Increases in [Na+]i by addition of veratridine markedly enhanced glycoside-inhibitable respiration and lactate production. Calculations of the rates of ATP synthesis necessary to support the operation of the pump showed that greater than 90\% of the energy was derived from oxidative phosphorylation. Consistent with this: (a) the ouabain-sensitive Rb/O2 ratio was close to 12 (i.e., Rb/ATP ratio of 2); (b) inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis by Amytal resulted in a decrease in the glycoside-dependent rate of 86Rb uptake. Analyses of the mechanisms responsible for activation of the energy-producing pathways during enhanced Na and K movements indicate that glycolysis is predominantly stimulated by increase in activity of phosphofructokinase mediated via a rise in the concentrations of adenosine monophosphate [AMP] and inorganic phosphate [Pi] and a fall in the concentration of phosphocreatine [PCr]; the main moving force for the elevation in mitochondrial ATP generation is the decline in [ATP]/[ADP] [Pi] (or equivalent) and consequent readjustments in the ratio of the intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotides [( NAD]m/[NADH]m). Direct stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by calcium appears to be of secondary importance. It is concluded that synaptosomal Na/K pump is fueled primarily by oxidative phosphorylation and that a fall in [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] is the chief factor responsible for increased energy production.},

	abstract = {We have developed a model of cardiac atrial electrical activity based on voltage-clamp measurements obtained from single cells isolated from the bullfrog atrium. These measurements have allowed us to simulate a number of processes thought to be important in action potential initiation, repolarization, and the excitation-contraction (EC) coupling process. In this atrial model, the cell membrane contains both channel-mediated (Na+, Ca2+, inward rectifier K+, delayed rectifier K+, linear background leak) and transporter-mediated (Na(+)-K+ pump, Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, Ca2+ pump) currents. The cell is surrounded extracellularly by a diffusion-limited space. The intracellular volume contains Ca2(+)-binding proteins (calmodulin, troponin). The model makes several important predictions. 1) Incomplete inactivation of the Ca2+ current provides an inward current the maintains the plateau of the action potential. 2) Activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current initiates repolarization. 3) Due to Ca2+ buffering by myoplasmic proteins the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger current is relatively small and has little influence on repolarization. 4) The Na(+)-K+ pump current does not play a major role in repolarization. 5) K+ accumulation and Ca2+ depletion may occur in the extracellular spaces. 6) Modulation of EC coupling is governed by interactions between the myoplasmic Ca2(+)-binding proteins; specifically, the inotropic "positive staircase effect" may be explained by interactions between Ca2+ and Mg2+ at a competitive binding site on troponin. When considered in conjunction with the results of our model of primary pacemaking in the sinus venosus [Rasmusson et al., Am. J. Physiol. 259 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 28): H352-H369, 1990], this atrial model shows how the presence or absence of certain transmembrane currents can change action potential characteristics and consequently alter the relative influence of the various transporter-mediated and channel-mediated currents.},

	abstract = {Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is one of the main causes of death in the Western world. According to one hypothesis, the chaotic excitation dynamics during VF are the result of dynamical instabilities in action potential duration (APD) the occurrence of which requires that the slope of the APD restitution curve exceeds 1. Other factors such as electrotonic coupling and cardiac memory also determine whether these instabilities can develop. In this paper we study the conditions for alternans and spiral breakup in human cardiac tissue. Therefore, we develop a new version of our human ventricular cell model, which is based on recent experimental measurements of human APD restitution and includes a more extensive description of intracellular calcium dynamics. We apply this model to study the conditions for electrical instability in single cells, for reentrant waves in a ring of cells, and for reentry in two-dimensional sheets of ventricular tissue. We show that an important determinant for the onset of instability is the recovery dynamics of the fast sodium current. Slower sodium current recovery leads to longer periods of spiral wave rotation and more gradual conduction velocity restitution, both of which suppress restitution-mediated instability. As a result, maximum restitution slopes considerably exceeding 1 (up to 1.5) may be necessary for electrical instability to occur. Although slopes necessary for the onset of instabilities found in our study exceed 1, they are within the range of experimentally measured slopes. Therefore, we conclude that steep APD restitution-mediated instability is a potential mechanism for VF in the human heart.},

	abstract = {The experimental and clinical possibilities for studying cardiac arrhythmias in human ventricular myocardium are very limited. Therefore, the use of alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. In this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of human ventricular cells that, while including a high level of electrophysiological detail, is computationally cost-effective enough to be applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of reentrant arrhythmias. The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the major ionic currents: the fast sodium, L-type calcium, transient outward, rapid and slow delayed rectifier, and inward rectifier currents. The model includes a basic calcium dynamics, allowing for the realistic modeling of calcium transients, calcium current inactivation, and the contraction staircase. We are able to reproduce human epicardial, endocardial, and M cell action potentials and show that differences can be explained by differences in the transient outward and slow delayed rectifier currents. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed data on action potential duration restitution, which is an important characteristic for reentrant arrhythmias. The conduction velocity restitution of our model is broader than in other models and agrees better with available data. Finally, we model the dynamics of spiral wave rotation in a two-dimensional sheet of human ventricular tissue and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a period of 265 ms. We conclude that the proposed model reproduces a variety of electrophysiological behaviors and provides a basis for studies of reentrant arrhythmias in human ventricular tissue.},

	abstract = {Background— Although pharmacological block of the slow, delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) by chromanol 293B, L-735,821, or HMR-1556 produces little effect on action potential duration (APD) in isolated rabbit and dog ventricular myocytes, the effect of IKs block on normal human ventricular muscle APD is not known. Therefore, studies were conducted to elucidate the role of IKs in normal human ventricular muscle and in preparations in which both repolarization reserve was attenuated and sympathetic activation was increased by exogenous dofetilide and adrenaline.
Methods and Results— Preparations were obtained from undiseased organ donors. Action potentials were measured in ventricular trabeculae and papillary muscles using conventional microelectrode techniques; membrane currents were measured in ventricular myocytes using voltage-clamp techniques. Chromanol 293B (10 μmol/L), L-735,821 (100 nmol/L), and HMR-1556 (100 nmol/L and 1 μmol/L) produced a {\textless}12-ms change in APD while pacing at cycle lengths ranging from 300 to 5000 ms, whereas the IKr blockers sotalol and E-4031 markedly lengthened APD. In voltage-clamp experiments, L-735,821 and chromanol 293B each blocked IKs in the presence of E-4031 to block IKr. The E-4031–sensitive current (IKr) at the end of a 150-ms-long test pulse to 30 mV was 32.9±6.7 pA (n=8); the L-735,821–sensitive current (IKs) magnitude was 17.8±2.94 pA (n=10). During a longer 500-ms test pulse, IKr was not substantially changed (33.6±6.1 pA; n=8), and IKs was significantly increased (49.6±7.24 pA; n=10). On application of an “action potential–like” test pulse, IKr increased as voltage became more negative, whereas IKs remained small throughout all phases of the action potential–like test pulse. In experiments in which APD was first lengthened by 50 nmol/L dofetilide and sympathetic activation was increased by 1 μmol/L adrenaline, 1 μmol/L HMR-1556 significantly increased APD by 14.7±3.2\% (P{\textless}0.05; n=3).
Conclusions— Pharmacological IKs block in the absence of sympathetic stimulation plays little role in increasing normal human ventricular muscle APD. However, when human ventricular muscle repolarization reserve is attenuated, IKs plays an increasingly important role in limiting action potential prolongation.},

	abstract = {1. The rate of heat production (heat rate) and isometric twitch tension of ventricular trabeculae isolated from guinea-pig heart were measured at 37 degrees C in order to determine the relative contributions of actomyosin-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase and Na+,K(+)-ATPase to myocardial energy metabolism. 2. The increase in heat rate recorded during isometric contractions at optimal length (contraction-related heat production) was 19.1 +/- 1.2 mW cm-3 at a stimulation rate of 2 Hz. The tension-time integral of individual contractions measured under the same conditions was 147 +/- 15 mM s cm-2. 3. The heat production of the actomyosin-ATPase was determined by inhibiting the contractile proteins with 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM). Contraction-related heat production was reduced by 0.219 +/- 0.010 and the isometric tension-time integral was reduced by 0.288 +/- 0.016 in the presence of 1 mM BDM. From these data an estimate of 0.76 for the relative contribution of the actomyosin-ATPase to contraction-related heat production was derived. 4. The heat production related to actomyosin-ATPase plus Ca(2+)-ATPase was studied by blocking Ca2+ influx into the myocardial cells with a solution containing 100 microM Ca2+ and 400 microM Ni2+. In this solution contraction-related heat production was reduced by 0.907 +/- 0.012. Comparison of this value with the component attributable to the actomyosin-ATPase yields an estimate of 0.15 for the relative contribution of the Ca(2+)-ATPase to contraction related heat production. 5. The heat production related to the Na+,K(+)-ATPase in resting preparations was studied by blocking the sodium pump with 400 microM dihydro-ouabain (DHO). DHO produced a transient decrease in heat rate lasting 1-2 min, which was followed by a secondary increase. From the heat transient produced by DHO the heat rate related to the Na+,K(+)-ATPase in the steady state was extrapolated. The relative contribution of the sodium pump to resting heat production was estimated to be 0.17. 6. The heat production related to the Na+,K(+)-ATPase in contracting preparations was studied by first blocking Ca2+ influx with 100 microM Ca2+ and 400 microM Ni2+, and then inhibiting the sodium pump with 400 microM dihydro-ouabain (DHO). The relative contribution of the sodium pump to contraction-related heat production extrapolated from these data was 0.10, which agreed well with the fraction of contraction-related heat production persisting after blockage of actomyosin-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase (0.09).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

This interaction can be linear or nonlinear, leading to different classes of models for voltage-dependent ion channels.Detailed DescriptionIntroductionThe first quantitative description of the voltage dependence of ionic currents and their role in generating action potentials was provided by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952). This description, however, was semiempirical. They postulated that the ionic conductance was dependent on the assembly of “gating particles,” acting independently and in a voltage-dependent manner.

	abstract = {Single ventricular cells were enzymatically isolated from adult guinea-pig hearts (Isenberg \& Klöckner, 1982). The patch-clamp technique (Hamill, Marty, Neher, Sakmann \& Sigworth, 1981) was used to examine the conductance properties of an inward-rectifying K+ channel present in their sarcolemmal membrane. When the K+ concentration on the extracellular side of the patch was between 10.8 and 300 mM, inward current steps were observed at potentials more negative than the K+ equilibrium potential (EK). At more positive potentials no current steps were detectable, demonstrating the strong rectification of the channel. The zero-current potential extrapolated from the voltage dependence of the inward currents depends on the external K4 concentration [K+]o in a fashion expected for a predominantly K+-selective ion channel. It is shifted by 49 mV for a tenfold change in [K+]o. The conductance of the channel depends on the square root of [K+]o. In approximately symmetrical transmembrane K+ concentrations (145 mM-external K+), the single-channel conductance is 27 pS (at 19-23 degrees C). In normal Tyrode solution (5.4 mM-external K+) we calculate a single-channel conductance of 3.6 pS. The size of inward current steps at a fixed negative membrane potential V increases with [K+]o. The relation between step size and [K+]o shows saturation. Assuming a Michaelis-Menten scheme for binding of permeating K+ to the channel, an apparent binding constant of 210 mM is calculated for a membrane potential of -100 mV. For this potential the current at saturating [K+]o is estimated as 6.5 pA. The rectification of the single-channel conductance at membrane potentials positive to EK occurs within 1.5 ms of stepping the membrane potential from a potential of high conductance to one of low conductance. In addition to the main conductance state, the channel can adopt several substates of conductance. The main state could be the result of the simultaneous opening of four conducting subunits, each of which has a conductance of about 7 pS in 145 mM-external K+. The density of the inward-rectifying K+ channels in the ventricular sarcolemma is 0-10 channel/10 micron2 of surface membrane; the average of twenty-eight patches was 1 channel/1.8 micron2. It is concluded that the inward-rectifying K+ channels mediate the resting K+ conductance of ventricular heart muscle and the current termed IK1 in conventional voltage-clamp experiments.},

(i) Parameter unidentifiability (found in 9 out of 13 of the considered models) results in an inability to determine the correct layout of a model, contradicting the idea that model structure and parameters provide insights into underlying molecular processes. (ii) The information content of experimental voltage step clamp data is discussed, and a short but sufficient protocol for parameter estimation is presented. (iii) MMs have been associated with high computational cost (owing to their large number of state variables), presenting an obstacle for multicellular whole organ simulations as well as parameter estimation. It is shown that the stiffness of models increases computation time more than the number of states.

	abstract = {Abstract Two distinct delayed rectifier K+ currents, IKr and IKs, were found recently in ventricular cells. We formulated these currents theoretically and investigated their roles in action potential repolarization and the restitution of action potential duration (APD). The Luo-Rudy (L-R) model of the ventricular action potential was used in the simulations. The single delayed rectifier K+ current in the model was replaced by IKr and IKs. Our results show that IKs is the major outward current during the plateau repolarization. A specific block of either IKr or IKs can effectively prolong APD to the same degree. Therefore, either channel provides a target for class III antiarrhythmic drugs. In the simulated guinea pig ventricular cell, complete block of IKr does not result in early afterdepolarizations (EADs). In contrast, {\textgreater}80\% block of IKs results in abnormal repolarization and EADs. This behavior reflects the high IKs-to-IKr density ratio (≈8:1) in this cell and can be reversed (ie, IKr block can cause EADs) by reducing the ratio of Iks to IKr. The computed APD restitution curve is consistent with the experimental behavior, displaying fast APD variation at short diastolic intervals (DIs) and downward shift at longer DIs with the decrease of basic drive cycle length (BCL). Examining the ionic currents and their underlying kinetic processes, we found that activation of both IKr and IKs is the primary determinant of the APD restitution at shorter DIs, with Ca2+ current through L-type channels (ICa) playing a minor role. The rate of APD change depends on the relative densities of IKr and IKs; it increases when the IKr-to-IKs density ratio is large. The BCL-dependent shift of restitution at longer DIs is primarily attributed to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+]i. This in turn causes different degrees of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICa and different degrees of Ca2+-dependent conductance of IKs at very long DIs ({\textgreater}5 s) for different BCLs. This BCL dependence of ICa and IKs that is secondary to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+]i is responsible for APD changes at long DIs and can be viewed as a “memory property” of cardiac cells.},

	abstract = {Background—A growing body of evidence suggests that heterogeneity of ion channel expression and electrophysiological characteristics is an important property of the ventricular myocardium. The 2 components of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr (rapid) and IKs (slow), play a dominant role in the repolarization of the action potential and are important determinants of its duration.
Methods and Results—In this report, the effects of heterogeneities of IKr and IKs on action potential duration (APD) and its rate dependence (adaptation) are studied with the use of the LRd model of a mammalian ventricular cell. Results demonstrate the importance of IKs density variations in heterogeneity of repolarization. Cells with reduced IKs (eg, mid-myocardial M cells) display long APD and steep dependence of APD on rate. Mechanistically, accumulation of IKs activation and increased sodium calcium exchange current, INaCa, secondary to Na+ accumulation at a fast rate underlie the steep APD-rate relation of these cells. When cells are electrotonically coupled in a multicellular fiber through resistive gap junction, APD differences are reduced. The results demonstrate strong dependence of APD heterogeneity on the degree of intercellular coupling even in the normal physiological range. Highly reduced coupling maximizes APD heterogeneity.
Conclusions—Heterogeneity of IKs:IKr density strongly influences APD and its rate dependence. However, in the intact myocardium, the degree of gap-junction coupling may be an important factor that determines the manifestation of APD heterogeneity and dispersion of repolarization. The clinical significance of this study is in the context of repolarization abnormalities and associated arrhythmias (eg, long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes).},

	abstract = {Background—Left ventricular or biventricular pacing/stimulation can acutely improve systolic function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and intraventricular conduction delay by resynchronizing contraction. Most heart failure therapies directly enhancing systolic function do so while concomitantly increasing myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). We hypothesized that pacing/stimulation, in contrast, incurs systolic benefits without raising energy demand.
Methods and Results—Ten DCM patients with left bundle-branch block (ejection fraction 20±3\%, QRS duration179±3 ms, mean±SEM) underwent cardiac catheterization to measure ventricular and aortic pressure, coronary blood flow, arterial–coronary sinus oxygen difference (ΔAVO2), and MV̇O2. Data were measured under sinus rhythm or with left ventricular or biventricular pacing/stimulation at the same heart rate. These results were then contrasted to intravenous dobutamine (n=7) titrated to match systolic changes during LV pacing. Systolic function rose quickly and substantially from LV pacing (18±4\% rise in arterial pulse pressure, which correlates with cardiac output, and 43±6\% increase in dP/dtmax; both P{\textless}0.01). However, ΔAVO2 and MV̇O2 declined −4±2\% and −8±6.5\%, respectively (both P{\textless}0.05). Similar results were obtained with biventricular activation. In contrast, dobutamine raised dP/dtmax 37±6\%, accompanied by a 22±11\% rise in per-beat MV̇O2 (P{\textless}0.05 versus pacing).
Conclusions—Ventricular resynchronization by left ventricular or biventricular pacing/stimulation in DCM patients with left bundle-branch block acutely enhances systolic function while modestly lowering energy cost. This should prove valuable for treating DCM patients with basal dyssynchrony.},

Regarding the plasticity, we consider Hebbian rules, specifically for spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and with regard to network, we consider that the connections are randomly distributed. We analyse the synchronisation and desynchronisation according to an input level and probability of connections. Moreover, we verify that the transition for synchronisation depends on the neuronal network architecture, and the external perturbation level.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein, resulting in increased production of a self-aggregating form of beta amyloid (Aβ). Several lines of work on AD patients and transgenic mice with high Aβ levels exhibit altered rhythmicity, aberrant neuronal network activity and hyperexcitability reflected in clusters of hyperactive neurons, and spontaneous epileptic activity. Recent studies highlight that abnormal accumulation of Aβ changes intrinsic properties of inhibitory neurons, which is one of the main reasons underlying the impaired network activity. However, specific cellular mechanisms leading to interneuronal dysfunction are not completely understood. Using extended Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) formalism in conjunction with patch-clamp experiments, we investigate the mechanisms leading to the impaired activity of interneurons. Our detailed analysis indicates that increased Na+ leak explains several observations in inhibitory neurons, including their failure to reliably produce action potentials, smaller action potential amplitude, increased resting membrane potential, and higher membrane depolarization in response to a range of stimuli in a model of APPSWE/PSEN1DeltaE9 (APdE9) AD mice as compared to age-matched control mice. While increasing the conductance of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channel could account for most of the observations, the extent of increase required to reproduce these observations render such changes unrealistic. Furthermore, increasing the conductance of HCN does not account for the observed changes in depolarizability of interneurons from APdE9 mice as compared to those from NTG mice. None of the other pathways tested could lead to all observations about interneuronal dysfunction. Thus we conclude that upregulated sodium leak is the most likely source of impaired interneuronal function.},

	abstract = {Evolution of animal morphology, physiology and behaviour is shaped by the selective pressures to which they are subject. Some selective pressures act to increase the benefits accrued whilst others act to reduce the costs incurred, affecting the cost/benefit ratio. Selective pressures therefore produce a trade-off between costs and benefits that ultimately influences the fitness of the whole organism. The nervous system has a unique position as the interface between morphology, physiology and behaviour; the final output of the nervous system is the behaviour of the animal, which is a product of both its morphology and physiology. The nervous system is under selective pressure to generate adaptive behaviour, but at the same time is subject to costs related to the amount of energy that it consumes. Characterising this trade-off between costs and benefits is essential to understanding the evolution of nervous systems, including our own. Within the nervous system, sensory systems are the most amenable to analysing costs and benefits, not only because their function can be more readily defined than that of many central brain regions and their benefits quantified in terms of their performance, but also because recent studies of sensory systems have begun to directly assess their energetic costs. Our review focuses on the visual system in particular, although the principles we discuss are equally applicable throughout the nervous system. Examples are taken from a wide range of sensory modalities in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We aim to place the studies we review into an evolutionary framework. We combine experimentally determined measures of energy consumption from whole retinas of rabbits and flies with intracellular measurements of energy consumption from single fly photoreceptors and recently constructed energy budgets for neural processing in rats to assess the contributions of various components to neuronal energy consumption. Taken together, these studies emphasize the high costs of maintaining neurons at rest and whilst signalling. A substantial proportion of neuronal energy consumption is related to the movements of ions across the neuronal cell membrane through ion channels, though other processes such as vesicle loading and transmitter recycling also consume energy. Many of the energetic costs within neurons are linked to 3Na(+)/2K(+) ATPase activity, which consumes energy to pump Na(+) and K(+) ions across the cell membrane and is essential for the maintenance of the resting potential and its restoration following signalling. Furthermore, recent studies in fly photoreceptors show that energetic costs can be related, via basic biophysical relationships, to their function. These findings emphasize that neurons are subject to a law of diminishing returns that severely penalizes excess functional capacity with increased energetic costs. The high energetic costs associated with neural tissue favour energy efficient coding and wiring schemes, which have been found in numerous sensory systems. We discuss the role of these efficient schemes in reducing the costs of information processing. Assessing evidence from a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate examples, we show that reducing energy expenditure can account for many of the morphological features of sensory systems and has played a key role in their evolution.},

References 109The cardiac cell is a complex biological system where various processes interact to generate electrical excitation (the action potential, AP) and contraction. During AP generation, membrane ion channels interact nonlinearly with dynamically changing ionic concentrations and varying transmembrane voltage, and are subject to regulatory processes. In recent years, a large body of knowledge has accumulated on the molecular structure of cardiac ion channels, their function, and their modification by genetic mutations that are associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. However, ion channels are typically studied in isolation (in expression systems or isolated membrane patches), away from the physiological environment of the cell where they interact to generate the AP. A major challenge remains the integration of ion-channel properties into the functioning, complex and highly interactive cell system, with the objective to relate molecular-level processes and their modification by disease to whole-cell function and clinical phenotype. In this article we describe how computational biology can be used to achieve such integration. We explain how mathematical (Markov) models of ion-channel kinetics are incorporated into integrated models of cardiac cells to compute the AP. We provide examples of mathematical (computer) simulations of physiological and pathological phenomena, including AP adaptation to changes in heart rate, genetic mutations in SCN5A and HERG genes that are associated with fatal cardiac arrhythmias, and effects of the CaMKII regulatory pathway and β-adrenergic cascade on the cell electrophysiological function.},

	abstract = {1. Depolarizing pulses positive to 0 mV elicit a transient outward current (Ito) and a sustained 'pedestal' current in canine atrial myocytes. The pedestal current was highly sensitive to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and TEA, with 50\% inhibitory concentrations (EC50) of 5.3 +/- 0.7 and 307 +/- 25 microM, respectively. When the pedestal current was separated from Ito with prepulses or by studying current sensitive to 10 mM TEA, it showed very rapid activation and deactivation. We therefore designated the current IKur,d, for 'ultrarapid delayed rectifier, dog'. IKur,d inactivation was bi-exponential, with mean time constants of 609 +/- 91 and 5563 +/- 676 ms during a 20 s pulse to +40 mV. 2. The reversal potential of IKur,d tail currents are dependent on extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o; slope, 54.7 mV decade-1). The envelope of tails test was satisfied and the current inwardly rectified at {\textgreater} or = +40 mV. The current was insensitive to E-4031, dendrotoxin and chloride substitution, but was inhibited by barium, with an EC50 of 1.65 mM. Lanthanum ions caused a positive shift in voltage dependence without producing direct inhibition. 3. Single-channel activity was observed in cell-attached, inside-out and outside-out patches. Upon depolarization from -50 to +30 mV, single channels had similar time constants and [K+]o dependence to whole-cell current. Channel open probability (Po) increased with depolarization in a saturable fashion and the Po-voltage relation had a half-activation voltage and slope factor similar to whole-cell IKur,d. 4. Unitary channel current was linearly related to depolarization potential to +40 mV; at more positive potentials, inward rectification occurred. The unitary conductance was 20.3 and 35.5 pS for an [K+]o of 5.4 and 130 mM, respectively. Single-channel activity was strongly inhibited by 50 microM 4-AP or 10 mM TEA. Both 4-AP and TEA decreased open time, suggesting open-channel block. 5. Selective inhibition of IKur,d with 50 microM 4-AP or 0.3-5 mM TEA prolonged canine atrial action potentials, indicating that IKur,d contributes to canine atrial repolarization. The single-channel and macroscopic properties of IKur,d have many similarities to those of currents carried by Kv3.1 cloned channels and our findings thus suggest a possible role for Kv3.1 channels in cardiac repolarization.},

	abstract = {A sodium channel is composed of four similar domains, each containing a highly charged S4 helix that is driven outward (activates) in response to a depolarization. Functionally, the channel has two gates, called activation gate (a gate) and inactivation gate (I gate), both of which must be open for conduction to occur. The cytoplasmically located a gate opens after a depolarization has activated the S4s of (probably) all four domains. The I gate consists of a cytoplasmically located inactivation “particle” and a receptor for it in the channel. The receptor becomes available after some degree of S4 activation, and the particle diffuses in to inactivate the channel. The I gate usually closes when the a gate is open [open-state inactivation (Osi)] but also can close before the channel reaches the conducting state. This “closed-state inactivation” (Csi) is studied quantitatively in this paper to determine the degree of S4 activation required for (i) opening the a gate, and (ii) permitting the I gate to close. Csi is most prominent for small depolarizations, during which occupancy of the partially activated closed states is prolonged. Large depolarizations drive the S4s outward quickly, minimizing the duration of closed-state occupancy and making Csi small and Osi large. Based on these data and evidence in the literature, it is concluded that opening the a gate requires S4 activation in domains 1–3, with partial activation of the S4 of domain 4. Csi requires only S4 activation of domains 3 and 4, which does not open the a gate.},

	abstract = {Voltage-gated ion channels have at least two classes of moving parts, voltage sensors that respond to changes in the transmembrane potential and gates that create or deny permeant ions access to the conduction pathway. To explore the coupling between voltage sensors and gates, we have systematically immobilized each using a bifunctional photoactivatable cross-linker, benzophenone-4-carboxamidocysteine methanethiosulfonate, that can be tethered to cysteines introduced into the channel protein by mutagenesis. To validate the method, we first tested it on the inactivation gate of the sodium channel. The benzophenone-labeled inactivation gate of the sodium channel can be trapped selectively either in an open or closed state by ultraviolet irradiation at either a hyperpolarized or depolarized voltage, respectively. To verify that ultraviolet light can immobilize S4 segments, we examined its relative effects on ionic and gating currents in Shaker potassium channels, labeled at residue 359 at the extracellular end of the S4 segment. As predicted by the tetrameric stoichiometry of these potassium channels, ultraviolet irradiation reduces ionic current by approximately the fourth power of the gating current reduction, suggesting little cooperativity between the movements of individual S4 segments. Photocross-linking occurs preferably at hyperpolarized voltages after labeling residue 359, suggesting that depolarization moves the benzophenone adduct out of a restricted environment. Immobilization of the S4 segment of the second domain of sodium channels prevents channels from opening. By contrast, photocross-linking the S4 segment of the fourth domain of the sodium channel has effects on both activation and inactivation. Our results indicate that specific voltage sensors of the sodium channel play unique roles in gating, and suggest that movement of one voltage sensor, the S4 segment of domain 4, is at least a two-step process, each step coupled to a different gate.},

	abstract = {Sodium channel gating behavior was modeled with Markovian models fitted to currents from the cut-open squid giant axon in the absence of divalent cations. Optimum models were selected with maximum likelihood criteria using single-channel data, then models were refined and extended by simultaneous fitting of macroscopic ionic currents, ON and OFF gating currents, and single-channel first latency densities over a wide voltage range. Best models have five closed states before channel opening, with inactivation from at least one closed state as well as the open state. Forward activation rate constants increase with depolarization, and deactivation rate constants increase with hyperpolarization. Rates of inactivation from the open or closed states are generally slower than activation or deactivation rates and show little or no voltage dependence. Channels tend to reopen several times before inactivating. Macroscopic rates of activation and inactivation result from a combination of closed, open and inactivated state transitions. At negative potentials the time to first opening dominates the macroscopic current due to slow activation rates compared with deactivation rates: channels tend to reopen rarely, and often inactivate from closed states before they reopen. At more positive potentials, the time to first opening and burst duration together produce the macroscopic current.},

Here, we map out the relative weaknesses and promises of different approaches aimed at redressing this issue. While suitable procedures for estimation or inference of the whole (vast) set of parameters will, in all likelihood, remain elusive, some hope can be drawn from the fact that much of the cellular behaviour may be explained in terms of smaller sets of parameters. Identifying such parameter sets and assessing their behaviour is now becoming possible even for very large systems of equations, and we expect such methods to become central tools in the development and analysis of whole-cell models.},

The aim of model reduction is to circumvent this problem by eliminating parts of a model that are unimportant for the properties of interest. The choice of reduction method is influenced both by the type of model complexity and by the objective of the reduction; therefore, no single method is superior in all cases. In this study we present a comparative study of two different methods applied to a 20D model of yeast glycolytic oscillations. Our objective is to obtain biochemically meaningful reduced models, which reproduce the dynamic properties of the 20D model. The first method uses lumping and subsequent constrained parameter optimization. The second method is a novel approach that eliminates variables not essential for the dynamics. The applications of the two methods result in models of eight (lumping), six (elimination) and three (lumping followed by elimination) dimensions. All models have similar dynamic properties and pin-point the same interactions as being crucial for generation of the oscillations. The advantage of the novel method is that it is algorithmic, and does not require input in the form of biochemical knowledge. The lumping approach, however, is better at preserving biochemical properties, as we show through extensive analyses of the models.},

	abstract = {On the basis of a detailed model of yeast glycolysis, the effect of intercellular coupling on the oscillatory dynamics is analysed theoretically. The model includes the main steps of anaerobic glycolysis, and the production of ethanol and glycerol. Transmembrane diffusion of acetaldehyde is included, since it has been hypothesized that this substance mediates the interaction. Depending on the kinetic parameters, the single-cell model shows both stationary and oscillatory behaviour. This agrees with experimental data with respect to metabolite concentrations and phase shifts. The inclusion of intercellular coupling leads to a variety of dynamical modes, such as synchronous oscillations, and different kinds of asynchronous behaviour. These oscillations can co-exist, leading to bi- and tri-rhythmicity. The corresponding parameter regions have been identified by a bifurcation analysis. The oscillatory dynamics of synchronized cell populations are investigated by calculating the phase responses to acetaldehyde pulses. Simulations are performed with respect to the synchronization of two subpopulations that are oscillating out of phase before mixing. The effect of the various processes on synchronization is characterized quantitatively. While continuous exchange of acetaldehyde might synchronize the oscillations for appropriate sets of parameter values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally. It is concluded either that, in addition to the transmembrane exchange of acetaldehyde, other processes may contribute to intercellular coupling, or that intracellular regulatory feedback plays a role in the acceleration of the synchronization.},

The method proceeds by a stepwise reduction in the number of complexes, defined as the left and right-hand sides of the reactions in the network. It is based on the Kron reduction of the weighted Laplacian matrix, which describes the graph structure of the complexes and reactions in the network. It does not rely on prior knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of the network and hence can be automated, as we demonstrate. The reduced network has fewer complexes, reactions, variables and parameters as compared to the original network, and yet the behaviour of a preselected set of significant metabolites in the reduced network resembles that of the original network. Moreover the reduced network largely retains the structure and kinetics of the original model.},

	abstract = {Biochemical networks are not only complex but also extremely large. The dynamic biological model of great complexity resulting in a large number of parameters is a main difficulty for optimization and control processes. In practice, it is highly desirable to further simplify the structure of biological models for the sake of reducing computational cost or simplification for the task of system analysis. This paper considers the S-system model used for describing the response of biochemical networks. By introducing the technique of singular value decomposition (SVD), we are able to identify the major state variables and parameters and eliminate unimportant metabolites and the corresponding signal transduction pathways. The model reduction by multiobjective analysis integrates the criteria of reactive weight, sensitivity, and flux analyses to obtain a reduced model in a systematic way. The resultant model is closed to the original model in performance but with a simpler structure. Representative numerical examples are illustrated to prove feasibility of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Biochemical networks are used in computational biology, to model mechanistic details of systems involved in cell signaling, metabolism, and regulation of gene expression. Parametric and structural uncertainty, as well as combinatorial explosion are strong obstacles against analyzing the dynamics of large models of this type. Multiscaleness, an important property of these networks, can be used to get past some of these obstacles. Networks with many well separated time scales, can be reduced to simpler models, in a way that depends only on the orders of magnitude and not on the exact values of the kinetic parameters. The main idea used for such robust simplifications of networks is the concept of dominance among model elements, allowing hierarchical organization of these elements according to their effects on the network dynamics. This concept finds a natural formulation in tropical geometry. We revisit, in the light of these new ideas, the main approaches to model reduction of reaction networks, such as quasi-steady state (QSS) and quasi-equilibrium approximations (QE), and provide practical recipes for model reduction of linear and non-linear networks. We also discuss the application of model reduction to the problem of parameter identification, via backward pruning machine learning techniques.},

	abstract = {The sodium-potassium pump is widely recognized as the principal mechanism for active ion transport across the cellular membrane of cardiac tissue, being responsible for the creation and maintenance of the transarcolemmal sodium and potassium gradients, crucial for cardiac cell electrophysiology. Importantly, sodium-potassium pump activity is impaired in a number of major diseased conditions, including ischemia and heart failure. However, its subtle ways of action on cardiac electrophysiology, both directly through its electrogenic nature and indirectly via the regulation of cell homeostasis, make it hard to predict the electrophysiological consequences of reduced sodium-potassium pump activity in cardiac repolarization. In this review, we discuss how recent studies adopting the systems biology approach, through the integration of experimental and modeling methodologies, have identified the sodium-potassium pump as one of the most important ionic mechanisms in regulating key properties of cardiac repolarization and its rate dependence, from subcellular to whole organ levels. These include the role of the pump in the biphasic modulation of cellular repolarization and refractoriness, the rate control of intracellular sodium and calcium dynamics and therefore of the adaptation of repolarization to changes in heart rate, as well as its importance in regulating pro-arrhythmic substrates through modulation of dispersion of repolarization and restitution. Theoretical findings are consistent across a variety of cell types and species including human, and widely in agreement with experimental findings. The novel insights and hypotheses on the role of the pump in cardiac electrophysiology obtained through this integrative approach could eventually lead to novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.},

Most of these studies are performed using non-human cells. However, differences between human and non-human cell properties affect experimental results and invoke different mechanisms of responses to heart rate changes and to drugs. Using essential and previously unavailable experimental data from human hearts, we developed and validated an accurate mathematical model of the human cardiac cell. We compared cellular behaviors and mechanisms to an extensive dataset including measurements from more than 100 undiseased human hearts. The model responds to pacing rate and premature beats as in experiments. At very fast pacing rates, beat to beat alternations in intracellular calcium concentration and electrophysiological behavior were observed as in human heart experiments. In presence of drug block, arrhythmic behavior was observed. The basis for these and other important rhythmic and irregular rhythm behaviors was investigated using the model.},

In particular, under certain initial conditions, the solutions of the model equations will blow-up in finite time. We also propose a correction to the model equation of the sodium–calcium exchange current, and we show that the modified model agrees favorably with the original model. These phenomena also occur in the other cardiac cell models, such as those modeling the Purkinje fiber, the atrial cell and the ventricular cell.

	abstract = {The action potential model presented in our accompanying article in this journal is used to investigate phenomena that involve dynamic changes of [Ca2+]i, as described below. Delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) are induced by spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which, in turn, activates both the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger (INaCa) and a nonspecific Ca(2+)-activated current (Ins(Ca)). The relative contributions of INaCa and of Ins(Ca) to the generation of DADs are different under different degrees of Ca2+ overload. Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) can be categorized into two types: (1) plateau EADs, resulting from a secondary activation of the L-type Ca2+ current during the plateau of an action potential, and (2) phase-3 EADs, resulting from activation of INaCa and Ins(Ca) by increased [Ca2+]i due to spontaneous Ca2+ release from the SR during the late repolarization phase. Spontaneous rhythmic activity and triggered activity are caused by spontaneous Ca2+ release from the SR under conditions of Ca2+ overload. Postextrasystolic potentiation reflects the time delay associated with translocation of Ca2+ from network SR to junctional SR. The cell is paced at high frequencies to investigate the long-term effects on the intracellular ionic concentrations.},

Upon binding Ca, this carrier translocates Na and Ca. The existence of partially Na-loaded but nonmobile forms for the carrier (NaX, Na2X, Na3X) suffices to explain both the activating and the inhibitory effects of Na on the Ca transport reaction. Analytical expressions for Ca efflux and influx in terms of [Na]o, [Na]i, [Ca]o, [Ca]i, and Em are developed for the Na/Ca exchange system at equilibrium; these provide for a quantitative description of Ca fluxes. Under nonequilibrium conditions, appropriate modifications of the flux equations can be developed. These show a dependence of Ca efflux on [Ca]o and of Ca influx on [Ca]i. The large effect of internal ATP on Ca efflux and influx in squid axons, with no change in net Ca flux, can be understood on the single assumption that ATP changes the affinity of the carrier for Na at both faces of the membrane without providing an energy input to the transport reaction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

An holistic understanding of their behavior and regulation requires mathematical models that observe these constraints. However, kinetic models may easily violate the constraints imposed by the principle of detailed balance, if no special care is taken. Detailed balance demands that in thermodynamic equilibrium all fluxes vanish. We introduce a thermodynamic-kinetic modeling (TKM) formalism that adapts the concepts of potentials and forces from irreversible thermodynamics to kinetic modeling. In the proposed formalism, the thermokinetic potential of a compound is proportional to its concentration. The proportionality factor is a compound-specific parameter called capacity. The thermokinetic force of a reaction is a function of the potentials. Every reaction has a resistance that is the ratio of thermokinetic force and reaction rate. For mass-action type kinetics, the resistances are constant. Since it relies on the thermodynamic concept of potentials and forces, the TKM formalism structurally observes detailed balance for all values of capacities and resistances. Thus, it provides an easy way to formulate physically feasible, kinetic models of biological reaction networks. The TKM formalism is useful for modeling large biological networks that are subject to many detailed balance relations.},
